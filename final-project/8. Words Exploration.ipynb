      other founders include      which is a few billion in market cap right there  i will make sure to outline how idiotic the bloomberg blogger is and why he is merely a mouthpiece for the state  lmao   that is actually not a bad idea not sure if  would be interested but i would be open to it tomorrow morning i will be breaking down why the stimulus package is a net negative for the exact people that it is trying to help  ill explain both sides of the debate along with what the academics and wall street incumbents are missing  subscribe  there was 8 billion of onchain transaction volume in the bitcoin payment system over the last 24 hours  that is 2 trillion of annualized payment volume  while the academics and elites are debating whether bitcoin has value the market is adopting it at a staggering rate build products that the corrupt cant abuse decentralized products will be bigger than centralized products    yessir   later    yes there are very few entrepreneurs who could pull it off but i think jack is uniquely positioned to do it bitcoin is up 500 in the last 12 months and the 19 trillion hasnt hit yet call a friend today and ask them how theyre doing   he should merge twitter and square  mike  be careful using common sense on this website will make people very mad they believe the government is coming to save them and anyone who disagrees is spreading misinformation    hey thats blasphemy around here  good afternoon then  i was counting on you to have one today good morning to everyone   hope each of you has a great sunday     apply for a new job where you can help build the future and take back the system   appreciate you always fighting the good fight warren  thats the point  you cant just pick either you have to actually do the work to figure out the truth and the people who do come up with much higher numbers  youre proving my point your world view is based on intellectual laziness that relies on googling and accepting the first answer you see  your search shows less than 1 but mine shows more than 2  which is true    please tell me what you think inflation is right now  lol usdx what youre talking about in prior tweet is stable but relative comparison to other currencies  purchasing power is drastically down compare dollars to stocks real estate goods services bitcoin etc  youre really arguing dollar purchase power is stable  thinking the dollar is stable in purchasing power terms is completely insane  40 of all dollars in circulation will be created in 12 months after this 19 trillion  less than 10 of the 19 trillion actually goes to help people  plus im not arguing that giving people help is bad im arguing that creating new money to fund it is very bad  same creation bad of bailing out companies etc too  go back and read what i wrote last marchapril   the liquidity crisis the asset price inflation best and worst performers depression level unemployment and continued addiction for monetary stimulus  happy to hear what you think has structurally changed   yes exactly   it is both but you are correct interest rates play big role  well we can stahere  1 do you believe all socioeconomic classes experience same inflation rate  2 what do you believe inflation to be right now for bottom 40 of americans  3 do you agreedisagree that monetary and fiscal policy are not binary but rather used together  add in the fact that the lowest socioeconomic classes likely experiencing 610 inflation right now and explain how qe is good for them  my main point is plenty of money already in system without new creation to address problem while not making problems worse  so the 4 trillion of past stimulus which wasnt really given to the people didnt solve the problem regardless of inflation yet you think this stimulus package which majority is not going to the people is going to be different  you mean all these times ive said it        if they wanted to help people they wouldnt pass a 19 trillion package with the majority of the money going somewhere other than directly to the people  dont mistake their words for what their actions actually show  ive learned a lot from you over the years but i think youre drastically misunderstanding the situation  most data points suggest that last 12 months disproved your argument of what is going to happen this time  maybe this time different but highly doubt it  you cant argue personal income is up savings is up and people are in pain either theyre better off or theyre not  either the stimulus worked previously or it didnt we created 4 trillion over last 12 months and wealth inequality got worse  inflation also not lt 2    saquon barkley is now officially a bitcoiner   so would it be fair to state  90b in interest from 15 x  6t in stimulus over last 12 months  add in the principle and technically it would be 609 trillion although many will argue principle doesnt need to be  doesnt get paid back  agreed on interest rates but not sure i agree on stimulus not having impact too  sounds like youre more bullish on increased spending leading to positive outcome and im more bearish especially rising costs of goods for nontech  def agree time will tell amp market decides ok ive said my peace about the stimulus package   do your own research decide for yourself  you know where i stand  no one is coming to save you  you must not being paying attention here are a few examples where i said not to do it          need more  i was yelling louder than anyone that they shouldnt bail out the corporations or airlines last year check the receipts   i am the first person to explain that everyone should get financially educated and should have investable assets   that is literally what i spend most of my day working on  look at my tweets on personal finance just over the last few days as an example  if i give you 5 but make the goods that you buy cost 8 more i didnt help you i actually made your situation worse  this is what has happened over the last 12 months they gave people a small check but the cost of goods and services went up by much more  the unemployment insurance is less than people were already getting so technically they cut the insurance benefit  but you have socialist in your bio so i wouldnt expect you to understand  thanks for highlighting the difference between the financial media and the market participants  anyone who wants to understand what is happening from people who actually have skin in the game you can read the daily letter i write to 135000 investors  the equation is simple the government prints money asset prices are inflated rich people make money and 45 of those without investable assets get destroyed  hilarious and sad that the bloomberg blogger doesnt understand this    between you ross and myself there is one degree in economics and it aint the two of you holding it   yes americans got richer because they saved the 1200 that the government sent them   wrong the top 55 of americans got rich because asset prices were inflated and they are educated enough to have investments  bottom 45 got decimated because they have no investable assets  this is all less help than the people have received over the last 12 months yet somehow the rich got richer and the poor got poorer over that same time period  we have a financial education problem in this country and those without the education get destroyed by these packages  that is not what i said the dumb shit is the rest of the government budget which would be enough to fund these programs rather than creating new currency if it wasnt so wasteful   appreciate your intentional misconstruing my words though in an effoto get attention  i constantly tell people that investors win in these situations and those with no investable assets lose it is why i spend so much time explaining the importance of investing rather than saving shocking the bloomberg blogger who has been wrong about the economic situation for the last year still doesnt understand how stimulus widens the wealth inequality gap  based on his propaganda the gap should have shrunk with 4t in stimulus last 12 months right    joe you claim to have me muted yet continue to tweet at me i live rent free in your head  if the stimulus is so helpful how come the 4 trillion of stimulus over the last 12 months widened the wealth inequality gap rather than closed it   appreciate the kind words kevin have a great day  ive been writing extensively about this for a year now you can read the receipts at   yes the nyt is a great source of disinformation  inflation and devaluation of the currency is the number one cause of wealth inequality  given your logic the wealth inequality gap should have shrunk in last 12 months but instead it exploded and became worse  bitcoin the peoples protection from an undisciplined government the government just decided to enrich the financially educated and punish the financially illiterate  the lack of financial education in this country should be a national emergency  someone has to say it   march 18th last year people laughed but here is my i told you so  the stimulus package is called the american rescue package  it doesnt rescue americans it hurts them in a significant way  it devalues their currency and savings  we have the money without creating more we just choose to spend it on dumb shit that gets people reelected the us government is the greatest cause of wealth inequality in the last 12 months the government just voted to devalue your currency and savings if youre invested in assets rather than holding cash the government is going to make you rich as they flood the system with trillions of dollars stock market down big this week  senate approves 19 trillion stimulus package over weekend  the government has outlawed bear markets the us senate is just agreed to reiterate to the world why bitcoin is important and valuable senate just approved another 19 trillion to pump asset prices to the moon and push the bottom 45 of americans with no investable assets further into despair if youre making investment decisions based on prices instead of changes to your investment thesis youre unlikely to survive over the long term most great companies sounded too small or too ridiculous when they started  the tradeoff between efficiency and resiliency is a multicentury debate  a media publication that celebrates technological progress human advancement and encourages our young people to dream bigger would be an incredibly valuable property in the future we must decentralize the systems that we depend on   that is the only path to resilience   change your mindset and youll change your circumstances    stock market closed  banks closed  bitcoin always

protecting their balance sheets  when central banks will join us  what the world will look like in 25 years  bitcoin is the apex predator of markets enjoy   good morning to everyone except the people who think it is february 29th peter thiel allegedly built a 90 million taxfree roth ira  the crazy pathe maximum amount youre allowed to contrib every local and state leader should follow  lead and begin studying the benefits of embracing bitcoin  oh and  also lets you hold your private keys  that is why i am not only a user of the product for my own ira but choice became a podcast sponsor a few months ago to spread the word about this great wealth hack  so what are you waiting for  9 to summarize  1 you dont have to pay capital gains taxes if you trade in an ira  2 if you hodl long enough you dont have to pay tax when you withdraw from a roth ira  3  is the simplest way to open a selfdirected roth ira that lets you buy real bitcoin 8 if youre a hodler and believe in the longterm value of bitcoin youre leaving money on the table hodling outside of a retirement account   is the easiest way to change that 7  is a selfdirected ira that enables you to own btc other cryptocurrencies alternative assets and legacy assets stocks bonds etfs in one account  you can turn your btc gains into tsla and back into btc without paying a dime in capital gains taxes 6 while you have to be an accredited investor like thiel to invest in nonpublic companies you can also invest in bitcoin within a selfdirected ira   imagine how much thiels 95m would be worth if he had put it into bitcoin last march 5 the best pais that because contributions to a roth ira are made with posttax dollars thiel doesnt have to pay any taxes on the money he withdraws as long as he waits until he is 59 and 12  north of 94000000 in gains 0 in taxes  4 one caveat is most iras only allow you to invest in traditional assets such as etfs mutual funds stocks etc  so thiel used a selfdirected roth ira that enabled him to buy shares in paypal and facebook with his retirement savings before they went public 3 first it is important to understand that when you trade within an ira your gains arent considered to be realized so you dont have to pay any capital gains taxes  this allowed thiel to move his money around without having to pay 20 to the government 2 thiel is 53 years old assuming hes been maxing out his roth since he was 18 the maximum amount he could have contributed is 210000  so how did he earn more than 23000 return on his retirement account 1 peter thiel is a selfmade billionaire famous for cofounding paypal palantir and founders fund   he was also the first outside investor in facebook which has led to a net worth reported to be around 57 billion peter thiel allegedly built a 90 million taxfree roth ira  the crazy pathe maximum amount youre allowed to contribute to a roth is 6000 per year  time for a thread   elaborate would love to hear tomorrow morning  is writing a guest post for

in the same time frame   lol since when did the bbc become a tabloid ht  for the idea there are an estimated 468 million people in the world that are millionaires 06 of the worlds population  there

community is the most valuable aspect of the network    of course these guys really dont get it and believe bitcoiners are going to conform to bankers  lol the bankers and institutions are conforming to bitcoiners   listen to bill miller ross stevens cathie wood jack dorsey etc  they get it the bitcoin memes have done more for marketing the greatest store of value asset than any corporate marketing team could ever dream of   completely false  the biggest advocates of bitcoin are all meme lords  saylor musk chamath etc  it is funny to watch you guys debate the memes while the rest of us are memeing bitcoin on to corporate balance sheets pension funds and financial institutions   1 inflation is not 2  if you claim it is youre paof the problem bitcoin is going to suck incredible value

picture  im already in da club    fifty reference   it would be much easier and likely more profitable for them to hold a multibillion dollar equity or debt raise and then simply buy and hold bitcoin on the balance sheet the only way to ensure we have truly free markets is to build them on open decentralized protocols where no one can control them this is the most insane stupidest thing in the world  youre going to mentally destroy these children in pursuit of virtue signaling over science    they dont know yet at the end of the simulation we all just reveal ourselves to be the same person bill gates believes that you shouldnt buy bitcoin if you dont have as much money as elon musk  so bill gates believes elon musk and jeff bezos should own all the bitcoin  it is like one hero proving

a big portion of his portfolio is in bank and financial service stocks   they stand to lose a lot if bitcoin and crypto is successful  the fact that the media doesnt call these guys out on this nonsense is ridiculous     internet doesnt forget charlie  lmao charlie munger says robinhood is a dirty way to make money while he told people to take it easy on his portfolio company wells fargo

financial freedom for most of the global population peter thiel is a bitcoin bull  long term thinkers win wow galaxy digital reported 325 million in net income last quarter  make no doubt many crypto

good thanks for posting it philippe   the first mover and a bigger legend  tesla bought 15 billion of bitcoin around 33000  that means they have now made over 1 billion on that investment in less than 45 days  elon musk is a legend  additionally you cant claim that people are mean when you generalize a negative comment at an entire community bitcoin people are the worst and they tell you that youre wrong and probably shouldnt be tweeting that as an unbiased reporter  search me a single positive thing you have written or tweeted about bitcoin or crypto  no one actually believes your genuine or unbiased in your coverage 58000   please  no youve just been writing insanely stupid amp inaccurate comments about bitcoin for years  dont be upset when the bitcoin community is holding you

guys makes me dumb ill happily be the dumbest         of course there is going to be pushback by some there already is but the intelligent folks understand that the us stands to gain more from embracing this compared to what they stand to lose if they fight it     as a student of history you would know that free market money was gaining adoption every time before the government jailed the creator or outlawed it on a local scale  difference now is no creator to jail and adversaries incentivized to adopt it so free market money will win     that is true in the land of wall street  that is not true in the land of innovation and technology     that is archaic thinking   revolts and revolutions used to be fought with physical violence  now they are carried out via peaceful protests

debt is the only path to freedom  the us is no different 5 many people in the government or on wall street try to rationalize these issues  they claim that the deficit doesnt matter they say we can inflate the debt away  none of this is true rich people just profit from it  savers get punished investors get rewarded 4 the problem has become worse since 1971  we came off the gold standard gave politicians the ability to print money and now they are addicted to monetary stimulus  just like a drug addict we need a bigger hit in order to deal with the gyrations in markets  3 the deficit problem is not a cumulative problem though  we are running a larger deficit every year even though the government makes more money we still lose more money each year  this is the definition of bad business larger losses only ends one way  2 although the us government has made more revenue each year they continue to lose money year after year  the last time the government spent less than it made was in 2001  for 20 years the government has lost money insane  1 the us government has more revenue coming in the door every year  since 2009 federal income tax revenue has almost doubled  the united states is in really bad financial shape   the government has taken in more federal income tax every year since 2009 yet they lose more and more money each year  time for a thread    a quarterback who

are thinking   correct for rolling fund investors  some of the companies that ive invested in have already used regcf to raise a paof their round to include their potential community members    it is requirement for the rolling fund to invest in any deal that is syndicated  so only deals that get syndicated are ones where there is additional capacity that rolling fund cant fill  i pretty much ran out of accredited investor slots for the rolling fund so now only qualified purchasers will have opportunity in rolling fund annoying i know  next best option is the syndicate for accredited investors who didnt make it into the rolling fund  i dont make the rules im just forced to follow them even though i dont agree with them  yes have a rolling fund but consistently get allocations that are too big for the rolling fund considering syndicating some of those deals to accredited investors who want to coinvest but didnt make the rolling fund limit of 99 accredited slots  lol  varies based on the deal and will be available for review before decision  it is the most frustrating thing but that is the issue with the current regulations ok 800 people in 7 minutes saying yes is crazy  apply here if youre accredited    youll get to see the deal memo and details before having to decide if you want to participate or not   this is live depiction of us right now   your dad is the beast if i allowed

second question  what is the difference in inflation experienced by top 20 and bottom 20 of americans  ill wait for your math   the bottom 50 of americans not only have noticed but they have watched their wealth and purchasing power get inflated away  why is it not true new post inflation is killing the american dream  true inflation in the us is 10 and will only get worse over time wha  winners win bitcoin is a parachute masked as an adrenaline rush     happy to come on and have a rational conversation even open to having you change my mind   then theyre not bankers anymore theyve become bitcoiners   those arent bankerstheyre bitcoiners in suits  long bitcoin shothe bankers the occ statement to banks says that stablecoins leveraging decentralized protocols may be more resilient than existing payment options because of the decentralization   is carrying the team on his back right now unreal  never disrespect three things in life  1 the ocean 2 the internet 3 dogs the occ just told us banks that they must treat permissionless open source blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum the same way they treat swift ach and fedwire  game on  the bitcoin and crypto community just crashed the occ website   lol    wow nice work bitwise hit 500 million in aum today          does  count  i really like   and  too       you couldnt find the ocean if you were standing on the beach with that broke ass jumper you got    the last time we played you quit because you said its not fair that i back you down in the paint  true story dont make me pull out the tape    lol stop with the jokes that cant be real these interventionists are going to pump asset prices till the money printer breaks while at the same time pushing millions of americans deeper into poverty  stop the madness    linkedin is a dumpster fire of random connection requests and business development prospecting    does this make me a winklevoss triplet   just got word that we are moving it to later in the week so wont be today    just got bumped to thursday probably because of this gif lol     the bitcoin religion is replacing the us dollar religion among young people  why are you so prepared to believe data reported by your government   i appreciate you participating in my inflation debate to sta2021 now that our blood is circulating  you and i can tackle the new year appropriately     i think that is a fair answer and definitely can be defended adequately we just disagree which is what makes a market and creates opportunity so net positive  my guess is that it is much higher    ok so what do you think the difference is between the top 20 of americans and lowest 20 of americans  you think there is only a 3 difference or less in the inflation they experience    genuine question do you think cpi or chapwood is closer to the true inflation number for majority of americans    again what do you think is the difference between bottom 20 and top 20 of americans right now  my guess is that 10 inflation for the bottom 20 at the moment is conservative at best as an example    yes more great data    youre not answering the question which is telling in itself  what do you think true inflation is   we may disagree on whether it is 6 or 10 but hopefully we all agree it isnt 2 right    again this academic understanding of inflation and gdp relationship is not how it actually works  youre assuming there is a single inflation number for all geographies amp all socioeconomic status  what is the inflation difference between top and bottom 20 americans right now   youre evaluating a complex manipulated system from a singular point of view based on inaccurate data  we can stahere  what do you believe true inflation numbers to be  glad you enjoyed      do you believe the gdp numbers   ive read the rebuttals and disagree  truth new post inflation is killing the american dream  true inflation in the us is 10 and will only get worse over time what looks like a speculative asset to some today is actually the parachute that they desperately need       this is an incredibly valuable thread nice work new episode with social media star  is live   how josh built his large

increases the use cases  would you like to talk about it so you can understand it better dm me happy to take the time to explain it and answer any questions you have i wrote this back in october and

  now tsla  whos next tsla said it bought bitcoin for more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash  the message here is that cash is trash tslsa traded its cash in for hard sound money and tsla adding 15b bitcoin to its balance sheet is both a visionary and responsible move to the mars the new bitcoin whip is a green tesla   were up bro in retrospect bitcoin above 44k was always inevitable  tsla adds 15 billion bitcoin to its balance sheet buckle up were passing the moon and heading to mars  so cringe   basically instead of calling your bank and asking for a loan you send eth to an address like you send and email thats one example defi is not only the next frontier its a level playing field  bitcoin is the plan the us dollar is funny money doge is fun money  well your husband is right about one thing he will never touch any of the crypto that we are selling  because its completely digital   i wish i was as good looking as matthew mcconaughey but even that comparison falls shoim sorry you and your husband havent been listening to me about bitcoin and eth since 2013 if you had youd both be tweeting thank yous to me from your private island   my point is it that it no longer takes everyone doing this work but rather one or a few who are believed credible and then share it with a larger group like rwallstreetbets for many people to become informed theres a large baked in assumption by the fed that the average person isnt analyzing its balance sheet amp doesnt understand the longterm implications amp consequences of its policies rwallstreetbets challenges this assumption and may speak the truth about the emperors clothes  money printing redistributes wealth just not in the way you are imagining we will look back on sub40k bitcoin as a steal bitcoin gearing up to hit new highs  thes in bitcoin are winning   i only give my cash to bitcoin  at your peril  most definitely the money printer is getting ready to go brrrr for another 19 trillion

thousand dollar chunks next stop 2k     its happeningether eth above 17k   defi was always going to happen dont nickel and doge me the best thing about doge is everyone is a maxi when robinhood says they are standing by their customers and those left behind by wall street does this mean they will be why money so serious woof if you want to keep up with the fastmoving defi revolution  is all you need ryan and david are polymaths who bre  an inconvenient truth but its free bro they are democratizing trading 56 of robinhoods customers owned gamestonk at the height of the gamma squeeze rh was lending all of these gamestonk shares to shortsellers for 50 apy they made bank lending your shares to the shortsellers paid you 0 then halted your purchases so shorts could pileon everyones talking about how robinhood sells your orders to citadel as important is how they make money lending out your stonks and cash but give you nothing for it like your bank lending out ur cash and paying you no interest thats whats happening but its free they said doge is man and womans best friend im a doge lover papa elon is back we are all investorsuntil you stawinning then well shut off your buy orders

binged on their podcast this summer to level up my knowledge i also know its a goto resource for many  astronauts nan the game is not fair and it never has been individual investors even when operating in a swarm are destined to lose how do i know i helped design the game patrick mcconlogue former citadel engineer extra extra read all about it the antisocial network by  a book about

was fun great conversation       im live with  and  talking gamestop gemini bitcoin and facebook sponsored by  get up to 250  both troubling the thing that irks me the most is the this is free marketing such a lie and they led the entire industry down the path of telling this lie free trading is the biggest myth if youre not paying for the product you are the product ether eth starting to move its easily been the most undervalued crypto lately hello 1600  another dirty secret robinhood makes a ton of money lending out your stonks and cash they share none of this revenue with you they should have to disclose to you exactly how much they and their lending desk partners make from lending out your stonks and cash    rwallstreetbets state of the union we need to move away from a system with power in the hands of the few to one where power is in the hands of the many    but dude im not an actor lol there is nothing more interesting that the internet right now   defi fixes this  and i talk with  and  of  about rwallstreetbets gamestonk gme amc robinhood melvin capital citadel and much more  ether eth is mooning  ether eth has cleared its alltime high now trading above 1500  clearing houses are faceless organizations run by the suits and the banks they can move the goal post and shut off one side o dont overindex on strategy focus on creativity its the only way to play the infinite game with all of its unknowns the winklevoss bitcoin exchange is pushing into banking with a new savings product  want to earn interest on your crypto  has just launched an interestearning program where you can earn up to 74 new  is working with crypto lender  to bring in new investors looking for yield on their holdings   the battle to build a bitcoin bank is heating up   now offers up to 74 interest of crypto   is to robinhood should really be named pied piper its business model was to lure customers into the mouths of hedge funds by playing a magic pipe of fancy and misleading advertising robinhood could never do what it told you it could do ultimately it is and always has been in an extension of the centralized financial system same horse better saddle you cant cram experience the suits are now leaning on cash app to halt purchases in amc and nok   can we get a statement from the depository trust company dtc the central clearing house that is requiring robinhood and cashapp to halt buy orders in certain stonks until they increase their capital requirements public a retail broker will no longer engage in the controversial practice of selling customer order flow to market makers know as payment for order flow instead they will route customer orders to lit exchanges like nyse nasdaq iex and others    yes introducing gemini earn you can now earn up to 74 apy on your crypto held at    robinhood sells your orders to citadel this controversial practice is known as payment for order flow  fun fact this practice was pioneered by ponzischemer bernie madoff   cnbc pundits this could end in tears  melvin capital you were right  deep fucking value  the hedge funds didnt learn their lesson with gamestop gme they have started to shobitcoin good luck with that   i am a supporter of bitcoin   miami and  are leading the way for governments and bitcoin   go long the people shothe institutions the gamestop book and movie are already in the works from the guy behind 21 and social network  centralized finance does not promote individual rights the era of cryptocurrency has arrived how it started in 2004 citadel urged the sec to ban payment for order flow  how its going citadel buys all of robinhoods it is crucial that this ban include not only exchangesponsored programs but also payment for order flow arrangements entered into privately between order flow providers and market centers because payment for order flow creates fundamental conflicts of interest that cannot be cured by disclosure the commission should ban payment for order flow altogether we do not believe that a brokerdealer that accepts payment for order flow and does not pass such payments on to its customers either directly or through reduced execution fees or commissions can consistently fulfill its best execution obligations payment for order flow is a practice that on its face is at odds with a brokerdealers obligations to its customers a brokerdealer has a fiduciary obligation to obtain the best execution reasonably available for its customers orders under prevailing market conditions whether through wider spreads or a reduction in other benefits that otherwise could and should be provided to customers furthermore the parties making such payments either voluntarily or through an exchangemandated program are forced to find other ways to recoup the amounts of such payments brokerdealers accepting payment for order flow have a strong incentive to route orders based on the amount of order flow payments which benefit these brokerdealers rather than on the basis of execution quality which benefits their customers this practice distorts order routing decisions is anticompetitive and creates an obvious and substantial conflict of interest between brokerdealers and their customers robinhood sells your orders to citadel this controversial practice is known as payment for order flow   like true scumbags citadel actually urged the sec to ban this in 2004   citadel group urges the commission to ban payment for order flow   wall street bets has forever changed the hedge fund risk model probability of facing a coordinated shosqueeze by atomistic when the rwallstreetbets movie comes out ill be renting a bunch of amc theaters across the country w  for premiere parties well invite the actors for a qampa and the party favors will be

rwallstreetbets will be coming to an amc theater near you  apmex jm bullion sd bullion all citing unprecedented demand for physical silver silversqueeze rwallstreetbets has managed to build consensus among a decentralized group of outsiders on clubhouse tonight at 10pm la time it was easy for robinhood to close off one side of the gme market you cant stop rwallstreetbets from walking to the local if silver market is proven to be fraudulent you better believe gold market will be next huge implications especially for cou the ramifications of a silversqueeze cannot be underestimated if its exposed that there are more paper claims on silver tha bitcoin        check out  can be under 2 minutes to get verified rwallstreetbets    the silversqueeze is a rage against the machine if you think youre going to stop the people by restricting trading in gme and amc think again silversqueeze ride out and meet them bitcoin   thanks for sharing your thoughts on this the beauty of what has happened with wsb is that wall street is learning an expensive lesson that the way things have always b this is one more way that wall st takes advantage of the little guy if you are moving from rh look to see if you can find som markets are broken and the people have spoken doge is a protest people are tired of the modern money monopoly theyre tired of being told what money is and what they are sec to investigate robinhoods decision to restrict trading on gamestop amc and others good morning its saturday and stonks are closed bitcoin and crypto on the other hand are open another bullshit nonsensical excuse from robinhood  is completely open for bitcoin and crypto trading  who let the doge out  who who who who who   check out  doge is trending the people are speaking one of the things i miss most during the lockdowns is going to the movies when amc theaters open up im going to be living at them and buying tons of pop corn  and fountain sodas   deep fucking value markets are down gme amc bitcoin and doge are up the people have spoken is up we have not disabled buying and selling of bitcoin or any other cryptos   wall street bets is winning rip citron   you can read all about it in the charges that the sec brought against robinhood last month  so about that commission free trading that robinhood markets to you its a lie they actually sell your orders to citadel for unusually high prices they can do this because citadel gives you a crappy price so in the end its not free at all you end up paying a lot bitcoin in bio some more good news legendary investor  who runs the worlds largest hedge fund bridgewater is into bitcoin    we didnt build robinhood to make the rich people richer the mission is to help the everyman the rest of us to be paof the financial system  baiju bhatt cofounder of robinhood in a financial times interview in 2016   bitcoin  me bitcoin in bio power tends to corrupt and centralized power corrupts absolutely   wrong our mission is to power the individual through crypto check out our blogs and our mobile app  free markets for all  as long as we control them and they behave the way we want them to wall street bets understood the gama squeeze better than the suits but still the shorty apologists keep fake wondering whether or not wsb community understands the risks around trading gme  well apparently they understand the risks much better than melvin capital and citron the exodus has begun from wall street into bitcoin and crypto 420k followers secured  bitcoin just hitched a ride on a falcon 9 to the moon  plot twist bitcoin is headed to mars in retrospect it was inevitable bitcoin  janet yellen accepted 810000 in speaking fees from citadel owner of robinhood   reporter are there any plans to recuse given that robinhood banned longs on gamestop gme for the entire session today its only fair and proper that they ban short this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants robinhood  wonder the only 2 things that have unified our country in the last 2 years have been gamestonk gme and epsteins suicide dear  let me know if you need any help drafting the questions for the robinhood and citadel hearing ill make myself ava todays events remind me of this scene from casablanca  this place is to be closed at once  but i have no excuse to close it  find one   is  on the citadel payroll asking for a friend hey  any plans to reach out to the white house and sequoia for comment cc       is utterly shocked and dumbfounded by my suggestion that the suits may have called robinhood and told them to halt trading on gme amc and others now we know where  bread is buttered   robinhood was always lies and fancy marketing they never cared about the wall street bets crowd they only cared about selling the little guy order flow to citadel today they showed their true colors to the world no limit to how much you can bet against gamestop a company that employs 15000 but if you want to buy hodl and suppoth u cant sell houses u dont own u cant sell cars u dont own but  u can sell stock u dont own this is bs  shorting is lift the trading bans now let the people trade 2020 travel ban  2021 trading ban  whats next wall street bets folks have been told to quarantine no more trading now that theyve tested positive for citadel19 letthep  has an

and citron are the same folks who tried to kill tesla tsla  is the greatest entrepreneur of our gene and it turns out  is the biggest frauds of them all  democratizing finance for all except when we mani the pandemic made people appreciate bitcoin as an inflation hedge the deplatforming of wall street bets is making everyone ban it burn it banish it it just becomes stronger robinhood was never what it pretended to be it built its business on selling wall street bets order flow to the hedge fund citadel in the moment of truth we learned which customer it cares about the most this is the beginning of the end for centralized finance wall street bets community  welcome to bitcoin ethereum and defi some traders are more equal than others first they tell you you cant run your business then they tell you you cant trade next theyll tell you you cant wall street bets was putting their gammatine in place for the open and then robinhood decided to steal from the poor and give totally find if the establishment tries to destroy a business not ok if wall street bets tries to save a business and destroy democracy is not for everyone especially those unsophisticated amateur degen

provided for a comment period of only 15 da second the proposed rule is replete with ambiguity which will undermine good faith compliance efforts and also impede promis all while imposing substantial compliance burdens on the us crypto industry without commensurate law enforcement benefit all that this rule will do is drive bad actors to first systematically withdraw their crypto from existing

so here is a hint on the sellers  hodlers and longterm hodlers have been selling since late oct 2020 and increased selling lately   always have been miner pools are still accumulating on aggregate  yesterday there was another positive mnpc  despite some selling pressure today the outlook is still positive   strictly in the middle with occasional lowiq outbursts to actually earn something for a change    sir you have just succinctly described the whole financial system    those withdrawals havent hit the exchanges yet  if there wasnt a mistake on cq pathose withdrawals can also be sold otc which wont affect the price  unfortunately i cant test this assumption right now so this is a pure speculation     both schiff hip bitcoiner son vs boomer gold bug dad narrative will bring us tons of engagement  thats genius btcminers are now accumulating bitcoin after two months of selling  btc      narrative geniuses create religions    up only   no clue but they have insights into corporate and retail demand thats we know for sure   take a look at the previous positive period on the charts miners will accumulate until a the price is good enough and b there is enough buying orders to absorb their btc  until then its bullish  they might also know something altogether with saylor and square we dont   they arent buying just not selling what they mine on average     definitely gn so much data miners have stopped selling and started accumulating bitcoin   yesterday was the first day since dec 27 when miners position change turned positive  miners were selling their bitcoins for two months  bullish    agree more of a trade technically   where did you get that rare csw photo a few years back crypto wouldve prob nuked 80 now seeing 3050 dips be bid up ferociously by institutions

the way we have steth for staked eth  it can stay negative forever as there is no way to redeem underlying and there are other options now which makes the discount fair  still huge props to barry for locking up a nice chunk of the supply  hfsp  sorry i dont make the rules  please also check this   you dont care  youve put her photo into nft  shes yours now  more coming   heres another one  121k bitcoin have just left coinbase  tranches of such magnitude are rare and were spotted on jan 31 and feb 5 24    just inveyour charts  having fun intensifies  next time is see him i expect his eyes to

next  people love to worry   here   everybodys glued to the bonds      thank you appreciate the mention  lol per usual i dont think i have anything to add after larrys eviscerated that s1  great summary give it a read    not sure about your situation but if i had any dry powder left id but it on the spot with the intention to hold   yes   possible as were still 4452k range bound  but trading it feels like playing in front of a running steamroller funding is still amazingly low  this price of 50k isnt propped up by leverage and looks healthy   is it the same 13k or another batch   it is just the difference between the price of coinbase and binance  usually it means that there is some buying pressure on coinbase also it can mean selling pressure on binance  cryptoquant has promised to replace binance price with a basket of exchanges to mitigate it hey  is it yours  bloomberg microstrategy to buy more bitcoin after 1 billion purchase     pro the nature is healing  coinbase premium is persistently way above zero  good sign  dont follow low iq twitter larps if you are new to bitcoin  he doesnt understand onchain analytics nor mislabelled     need to do more research to answer this properly  but i think we will get our answer  naturally pretty soon  i see    confirmed by cryptoquant as well  133k btc has left coinbase 20 min ago  thats a pretty large withdrawal  last spikes of such magnitude were on feb 5 and jan 31  how it started           how its going   this tweet doesnt apply to the traders who know what theyre doing  i am but not because i believe in their infallibility its just that id rather deal with a drawdown than with extreme fomo of another btc rerating just because some huge ass corporation having bought in betting on crypto being drawn down by tanking equities is valid   you just have to realize that what you actually are betting on is the fed and powell failing to prop up the market despite their sincerest efforts  offended by your insensitivity to the hardships of woke hipsters in sf  this is not 2020 sir so this dip your paper hands sold btc to   saylor  square  purpose bitcoin etf  god knows who else  your donation is greatly

btc from the market yesterday   canada is drinking  someones milkshake  there will be more soon   not panic selling 0021 btc  it was never meant to be a trade as i am a longterm investor fascinated by the tech  dips deeper  and deeper  and deeper  trembling fingers click sell button in the middle of a night      curve is awesome always has been i was very bearish on crv initially but the team did a stellar job on turning the sentiment upside down fantastic speed of execution   has implemented the charts to track holdings and flows of  etf the worlds first bitcoin etf  adding as favourite        now you can take a lesson or two from    this is not how you troll my dude   this is all too subtle sir just compare the founder to hitler already   jokes aside she did a good job on the shilling front not his fault the project has tanked people arent selling theyre just fomoing into tether   will do it when  turns straight and  becomes eth maxi simply put no tether fud means more institutional and corporate buyers for bitcoin   this uncertainty really scared them  bloombergs tweet is poorly worded  that is what really happened   breaking bitfinex tether settle with new yorks attorney general for 185 million via    you like pretty numbers dont you  europeans and asians   some people deserve to just have fun sir   my ultimate top signal is when on a 30 dump everyone will be cheering and happy when there will be no angst at all  this is where i will let my russianness to get the best of me and jump on the bera train   yes sir  it did go up but it went down first  the market and media definitely didnt take that joke lightly    what happened  1 musks and yellens negative comment 2 miners taking profit 3 deleveraging  what didnt happen  1 ceasefire on money printing 2 actual choking regulation 3 institutions and companies stopped buying  the narrative is still intact chill funding gets to bearable levels   dear ct   i have repented and bought bitcoin   love peter i like how every 2030 dip beats the shit out of ct and suddenly narratives dont matter anymore and were definitely go to zero   every single time  2252 more btc 112m has been bought yesterday by  purpose bitcoin etf the worlds first bitcoin\\\\xa0 etf  this brings their aum up to 8288 btc  it is good to know who you sell your bitcoins to   its all too vague at the moment as it should be perhaps  timing and wording though     the grandmas farming clout like a pro this time is different and it is a new paradigm make good comebacks to brush off crypto until it actually is different this time and it really is a new paradigm   i miss trump and his memes analysts vs strategists  that was awesome sir  now up     think id rather be longterm investor after all   you think were going there  also possible   as usual fam this dump started with miners taking profits and continued as deleveraging  both events are bullish  the earlier miners sell their inventory the better  the narrative is untouched and this is a good point of entrance for corporate players   thats pain   in retrospect it was obvious that their vision into bitcoins future is amazing     yes just a chaglitch please ignore   awesome will delete the tweet then  thanks  me too but we surely see its representation on microstrategys sec reports  he is a visionary operating through the sec reporting public company  not impossible but highly improbable saylor has bought your bitcoins at the lower 30ks   he will buy them again at the lower 50ks   you know why   you know what happens next      congrats    my best guess is that some large miners stopped selling either due to the lack of inventory or other reasons  take a look at how sharply that selling started at dec28 which coincided with the position decrease of the miners grouped as others on the right cha   already did now is btc time   i love money    agreed but i have a good entry im spot and willing to hold this position for years if needed  also by allin i mean my operational capital not my immediate life savings  im allin btc believe me i am  unfortunately they seem to be slowing down on selling    and keep selling to saylor and someone else too  they deserve to derisk a bit and take profits  so bullish  also the majority of their selling is behind us i believe longterm holders and miners have been cashing out since the beginning of the year  all while the price was and is repeatedly breaking one ath after another  can it get any more bullish  up only  wallstreet wind gently rustling geishas fan paper hands   another two or three large public companies buying in and its a new paradigm sir  is he in the ambulance at the back  will make it all back in one trade   besides microstrategy there are some other drivers of demand as well that ethereum is lacking   nice   i believe its just apeing in as those stables are controlled by another entities the exchange generally doesnt have a say here   i think one of the answers here can be that a great deal of stables come not from selfcustody but from tetherusdc onboarding so it looks like they are deposited from selfcustody  also yes many use stables to farm and when fomo outweighs the apy they ape in   not sure about farming ops need to look deeper to answer properly i was commenting just on plain buying in   buying on exchanges is much simpler than using defi and cheaper also compared to uniswap while having deeper liquidity pockets on major exchanges  personally i prefer buying on binance as i usually deal in size on the other hand for smaller operations i go to curveuniswap   they could as it is pretty easy to make a point that people would be taking profits and withdrawing from exchanges to cash out to fiat  but it is a bit more nuanced because we need to track what exactly people will be doing with the stable coins once theyre off of exchanges   im not worried about them as all what matters at this point is whether other public companies will follow teslas and microstrategys lead  im positive that they will there was a record number of stable coin inflows to the exchanges an hour ago  7718 transactions an ath since november 2020  thats how you buy the dip   okay im buying my kidney back then  i like how they lecture you on positive vibes while criticizing you  it breaks my narrative but im not complayning   all we have for now but the block and bybt have promised to add the charts soon   some people even think that the aum is going to hit 1b in a week i wont be too surprised if it is   not yet but maybe we can ask   or  to build it  portfolio breakdown  3535 btc has been bought yesterday by  purpose bitcoin etf the worlds first bitcoin etf  if you arent tracking their aum yet you should be  not only we got another major driver of demand but also this gives us a taste of what the upcoming us bitcoin etf is capable of   their quarterly repois going to look sexy  legend coinbase premium has left the negative zone and reached 105 at the local high  this run started to receive some suppofrom the leading us exchange      udis cheating on you   bitcoins tail risk could be a hugeass meteor smashing the planet says lex moskovski  us citizens are here for you joe just drop that stimmy check   this bull has already demonstrated that a lot of macro experts and value investors have exceedingly poor understanding of network valuation methods   moreover they also keep showing incredible arrogance and ossification  you can try and argue with them but why bother  hfsp   there are always several of them to get the full picture but at the moment im focusing on anything tracking inflowsoutflows of both btc and stables and clusterings of addresses  that invalidates my opinion so also no  no  faster losses on sidechains  im sure more followers will stay with you your jokes aint that bad  what does he try to hide behind his right cheek   thank you appreciate it  this dip is being bought up heavily  lots of stable coin inflows to the exchanges  i doubt we see a serious correction anytime soon  funding is through the roof  this opens an opportunity for another virtuous circle  players engaged in basis trading have to buy and hold spot bitcoin to hedge their shorts that brings them that sweet yield  that pushes the price and funding even higher  rinse and repeat   oversensitivity is a terrible trait for a leader  makes me bullish on sushi  thanks   the only ta you need in this market  sorry mate im too focused on btc as it feels like much more predictable and superior trade at the moment however if there will be something of algo stable coin magnitude i may jump into it  keepin that ssr low since march 20    theres demand for usdt on tron 1 faster transactions 2 evolving defi infrastructure 3 lower fees  change your tax residence for something more favourable and make corpostate work for your hodl  however the us retail is screwed here indeed another 1000000000 usdt has been minted on tron  still worrying about the top   look into defi sir  there are a lot of ways with all flavours of risk to earn interest trustlessly   this is my way of summoning  back to twitter   yes but take a look at the other flavours like tbtc  you can use wbtc as a bridge to enter other wrappers that better suit your needs curve sbtc metapool will take care of that   it is just not bitcoingrade trustless   use any of the bitcoin wrappers on ethereum and curve   bullish as well    valid argument but why_not_bothjpg  ive been one of those stable coin liquidity providers on curve   ive capitulated bought bitcoin and provided it to my trezor instead  many lp will do too this is not the top not even close too much bullets left  take a look a the ratio of bitcoin mc to the amount of the stable coins on

asked several people and they literally think that tesla is getting into this for 10 gains  poverty mindset this run up to 50k keeps being dominated by buying pressure from binance and others as opposed to coinbase  this is indicated by a decreasing coinbase premium  however this may also mean that coinbase buyers join the race when the us wakes up  lets see   nice try udi im not selling my btc   good one although he might prefer to call it sexylexyhexy  he has a soft spot for me  write lex inside the hexagon it brings luck  some of them will even be the beneficiaries some paof me wants to never sell any alts to stay with the community forever  i call it lappel du povertie    lol  somehow this makes me feel less terrible about my own bad take    true but the amount of liquidity on sidelines waiting for a dip is still considerable  one might even make a point that expecting a crash is a consensus play right now  we will be this what has triggered glassnodes chamakes perfect sense  onchain data without context can be very misleading  heres the different between the supply held by addresses and entitie sorry false alarm it seems like its one of binance cold wallets  probably its time to build some custom dashboard on top of glassnode to track it more granularly omg i cant believe i missed it  huge whale has emerged on feb 12 with a single wallet balance of 118000

dumb people in finance is the ultimate source of alpha  love the industry   absolutely but with one nuance  im not entirely convinced that im the smartest guy in the room and have the biggest appetite for risk  so i try not to think of the next buyer as a sucker but rather as a less riskaverse person with probably better grasp on macro than i have  personally im not convinced that this scenario plays out  im definitely selling my bitcoins well before that to the people who buy this narrative  that being said i do believe that in some moment it will feel like usd is dying  thats when id like to pull the trigger irrelevant 50000 bitcoin  relevant 2 or 3 snp500 companies buying in  it is all about tracking the right signals to avoid a burnout and not selling early  old folks tend to know

valentines day be more romantic fify  slap yourself with love if you shorted under 30k  both teams are working on the next iteration of the mechanics so no   otoh its kinda compensated by it always going up when you sell innit the hallmark of this bull run is that the retail is going to be rinsed multiple times  already have been   so whatever ptsd top signals you have you can safely ignore them   does not apply to leveraged traders   people do though  perhaps binance whales are driving the price up while their us coinbase friends are deeply asleep and lagging behind  hence the dip in the

want to hit that sell button take a look at the sheer amount of liquidity being injected into this market  time to say fu to ta and hodl   nice psyops sir  we will never tell you did this   gbtc seems to be back in business  yesterday it has acquired 3461 btc  gbtc premium is still singledigit without signs of improving so the odds are this was genuine buying not arbitrage     i also have a pet hypothesis that eth might never be the ultimate collateral on ethereum  it is possible that btcs superior meme apparatus will cement its position as pristine collateral on all networks  not ready to die on that hill anytime soon just something to keep in mind    i agree on that one   however regardless of whether she is right or wrong she has communicated the consensus narrative  so this is exactly why we have the current valuations which was the question  tbh unlike his books and articles ive never found anything of value in his tweets  in my opinion  has communicated the reason exceptionally well    bitcoin whale clusters form when whales buy btc and do not move them  clusters showed that 44214 was a major cluster  people voting no will feel confident at 100k  50k or bust at the first glance the gist of this news is that the cashflownegative company is issuing more stock to buy into btc and other crypto immersion corp immr new prospectus says that the company may invest the proceeds to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  source 424b5 filing reported by the sec   also works   polyphasic sleep  its brutal but better than nothing  most of my top signals have already fired and been ignored  as it should be in the environment completely different from when they have been set up what is also interesting is that miners are not so eager to sell their bitcoin the last two weeks      it is in a way    also this     well they were selling on the uptrend starting on jan 1  many of them have capital costs to serve so it takes a good reason not to sell when the price is increasing   what is also interesting is that miners are not so eager to sell their bitcoin the last two weeks  either they are convinced it is going up or simply are out of bullets  any institution company and individual that holds any of the etf below or plain tsla holds bitcoin as well  tesla has pulled the ultimate trojan horse  lets welcome warren buffett and swiss national bank  holding tsla you are long btc     sir this is russia  you dont have to commit a crime to go to jail  the police here can do it for you allinclusive  gmi  will dump on you  looks like a huge wave of liquidity ready to pump the boats over the top sir top scares ninjas paper hands   they will rotate only if there is explosive btc growth  otherwise altcoins are supported by they own set of narratives and public figures  新年快乐  i mined and sold yfi at 2000    that makes perfect sense now  he wont keep his mouth shut about bitcoin    see   you can stop being salty now   i see some weird discrepancies that doesnt align with the whole chacan you look into it this particular case     you mean no difference by looking at the respective prices   thats possible but id argue that coinbase and binance have different audiences so hiccups on one shouldnt translate to the surges on another   theres also an increased stable coin inflow on exchanges  zero news yet  weird coinbase premium reached almost 500 two hours ago  thats even bigger than the fomo of tesla bitcoin news  meanwhile i see no significant news yet  somethings coming     no clue  im exaggerating to make the statement more dramatic but ive read zero noncringey ct replies on any celebrity crypto tweet great minds think alike      tesla having bought bitcoin may and probably will trigger some public companies to do the same  when they do the price will take care of itself  except bitcoin its about gf  shhh sir everything is about bitcoin   retarded_bears_pointing_to_2017_peak_chart_with_celeb_tweetsjpg nonanons should focus on being uncancellable   do not depend on the parties that arent comfortable with you speaking your mind  grow thick skin  eliminate weak spots that can be exploited by trolls and predators  enjoy your independence and the real name premium   broke btmfd woke pay a premium to btmfd   people on coinbase were willing to pay 208 premium to buy this dip  fantastic resilience   stablecoin inflows on exchanges are relentless  take a look at the intensity of the most recent spikes  at this point i wonder what the investment thesis of nocoiners is  that the richest person in the world with a gargantuan clout will keep his mouth shut about his investment   hit close to home   im talking about the tech   they surely are their main product is superior though   it looks like you really hate them   also true 1inch had its fair share of mistakes   im not disagreeing with this just doubtful that sergey really meant whatever words scott and others has read  also what i often overhear is that despite having worldclass engineering 1inch is shit at comms   if you havent experienced what i said thats great but if you can read russian do take a look at how russians interact on the social networks or telegram chats  basically what i am trying to tell is that we shouldnt attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance  he really like the word cesspool   its a cultural thing and i believe it has something to do with the soviet union heritage  interactions on domestic social networks always strike me as excessively aggressive borderline rude but thats just their baseline thats how they tend to express themselves   i noticed time and again that russians with a not so great command of english can sound like well thugs for lack of a better word  simply because they try to translate idioms literally and dont take into account cultural differences  good news dont spread  kudos to   sold it many times and bought it many times  any evidence  i cant remember where ive picked it up but liked it immediately noticed that i have stopped tracking bitcoin price after teslas coming out  the upcoming stream of corporations matters much more than the price the next two months  also the onchain data associated with it   bitcoin has been rerated but you still can hop on the train     not sure about this particular situation but i would bet that 1 is just translation issues  those guys dont strike me as violent or even aggressive  please mind the language gap russian connotations often dont translate well to english and come across as aggressive   so much pain  you can buy bitcoin but be publicly bearish for clout and engagement  this strategy worked wonderful for  what a spike  it seems the party is going on  spotted an hour and a half ago   well you cant sell gbtc immeadiately when buying via private placement there is a 6 month lock up period love it the dipping bitcoin price is met with sustained stablecoin inflow on exchanges  btfd onchain representation   yeah also glorifying those who happened  by sheer luck  to shothe top with the ongoing consolidation clearly visible onchain shorting has been a suicide mission since 30k  however bears are very welcome to try  their donations are greatly appreciated   can we have a gemini premium chaas well to get a better understanding on corporatefund buyers coinbase premium is getting increasingly elevated again and its a night in the us  either it is retail or somebody is twaping   i wonder what it will look like in several hours    yes  having such a breach and using it for a 4changrade joke is unbelievably retarded  i mean im not even mad just disappointed stablecoins keep flowing into exchanges  this is a byblock chaso the spikes you see at the right are very recent   gt you will be exiled from the citadel  tarred and feathered    have fun staying poor   im doing you job   not gonna work mate theyre selling it now to fomo back at 45k later thats what their ta ptsd hfsp and ngmi tell them not gonna lie elon and tesla today gave me the same feeling as paul tudor jones did back in 2020  ptj validated btc for funds elon just did it for public companies  im watching onchain like a hawk    there will be fud but institutionsfunds got there before the  upcoming majority of public companies  they are exactly the ones who will be dumping on snp500 ceos alas one more attempt of bringing an elasticoin back to peg has failed  perhaps because its so damn hard to solve the prisoners dilemma of defecting whales  nonetheless every failure contributes to the research of new pegging mechanisms  bullish for elasticoins  daiq   participating i guess  it seems like daiq is going to have its first expansion  liquidity is also increasing  buying pressure on coinbase is increasing steadily after chaotic volatility  you can easily spot the time when tesla broke the news  not trying to be predictive but it almost looks like somebody is twapping there   this man is an asset the day he buys btc im selling like theres no tomorrow  gt unfortunately more than two weeks  hey a deal is a deal enjoy your clean house for a month mate  just poor souls who forgot to take down their limit orders or are asleep  also paper hands but their days are numbered anyways so who cares  honestly i dont have a strong opinion on that yet more research is needed  tentatively i lean towards the latter too  well sometimes it is sometimes it isnt  i do believe though that its different this time market cycles still apply though  fundamentals are completely different this bull run is driven by a completely different kind of players and the macro is nothing weve seen before  i wish i could say i dumped on elon but im not selling im seeing a lot of ta charts unironically comparing this bull run to the 20172018 one  you guys should stop trading seriously  donate your capital to charity coinbase premium index is through the roof  thats going to be one hell of a trading session  cha tsla btc  tesla has bought 15b worth of bitcoin according to the sec filing  welcome onboard elon   also true  thats exactly how you end up in an echo chamber everyone was predicting a rotation to btc what ended up happening was a rotation to doge  im not that picky anyone with access to 10m worth of any crypto please add yourself to my paid spreadsheet  and send me some good whiskey thats nice and polite nothing builds relationships like hodling an underwater btc position together with your partner  highly recommended  are you trying to meme a new catchy phrase sir  have you tried unplugging your life and plugging it back in sir the rise and fall of rca the biggest growth story of the 1929 bull market    there are many flavours of tokenized btc and im not sure they are represented on this chaprobably  can clarify it  other factors possibly contributing to decreasing supply on cexes 1 more usable otc markets 2 proliferation of tokenized btc in defi 3 more opportunities for cexes to deploy their btc elsewhere  agree with the narrative though  btc gt eth gt defi gt btc  i didnt make the rules no sir  but yeah dips are generally for buying  sorry for being petty then i just cant see how its helpful to contradict anyone without providing compelling arguments and using the somewhat wrong we did reach 103 usdc btw it just hasnt registered on  prediction from dsd as the evidence  dont you think that wrong about this is directly contradict your next statement its staof weekend lets see what happens  if you mean im wrong about btc as i were about dsd then i agree    yeah makes sense  i still remember how they charged me 3 or something for a bag after i bought a 3k macbook a couple of years ago  great play  we all know the rotation to btc is coming and yet some of you are grasping to defi and buying this dip  why                        is so good he made it twice on the list     thats a million dollar question youre asking sir  dip10 probably is the answer  aye bae lt3 dxy annihilated vix obliterated btc mpi below 2 btc holders inflow ripping stablecoin cex inflow rising 1000 btc addresses upticking  honestly im out of bearish ideas at this point  as usual institutioncompanies are pouring in retail is next  risk on bitcoin nocoiners                 hfsp                     right fkn now   drop the second shoe sir   sure meanwhile ill be busy getting you drunk with nice single malt and on twitter so we have enough content for a sequel  you must be talking about my_bag  im winning dad   when i retire im gonna take a nice long sabbatical to write a treatise about  s issues with forking and it will undoubtedly advance the field of psychology in the area of phobias  until then we will be collecting mounting evidence and meditate on it  im just in denial dont like feeling old what also strikes me as significant is the lack of highquality memes we saw in the defi summer peak  it almost looks like the ultimate froth   i used to use it to farm sushi getting huge returns selling both in the end sushi at 12 and uma at cant really remember but way below 30 and feeling like a genius  pain   generally yes there are some nuances  as with everything in economics and finance  but strong dollar usually means that the music is going to be turned off soon   bitcoin and defi are riskon assets and those tend to be first in line to be sold when trad markets are tanking  crypto still depends on the macro but some people tend to forget it when everything is pumping  agree my thoughts too watch this one closely  no matter how bullish markets look it wont matter if dxy continues its uptrend  still bullish on bitcoin and defi but the macro shouldnt be ignored     right here sir  because we love fkn pain  first you tweet about serial killers now this   btw the replies with obv is obv wrong muh iron institutional hands    sir this is lexs we dont do good calls here  you wanna a bad call or psyops nan  toronto  ruggenheim fud  its russian for hfsp  saw this test in  s paid group an hour ago crazy volatility in markets means some overleveraged players are in trouble dominoes could stafalling  be careful o

bringing it back to peg making this pool a bit safer than the canonical pool 2  a happy yeltsin is the best yeltsin    the people with bigger capital will also enjoy the usdn pool   500µg adrenaline stat were losing him   chill dude no need to be offensive   read it aloud and summoned satan send help  poor staying fun have   well he didnt pretend that the monkey is happy as he specifically said that its not unhappy  zombie monkey is probably not an unhappy monkey either    my absolute top signal   depend on how aggressive i guess  it seems like a great deal of future money printing is already priced in serious tremors in global markets  liquidity behind decentralized mkt players overwhelming risk averse centralized legacy g  dan can you share a link for this report   yes already does      the fed has to think of new ways to stimulate the economy then because clearly the market was unimpressed the last time jpow tried to assurrrrrre everyone  you might want to add   having fun getting dumped on  for the honest people with underwater positions  imo the main bear case for btc is the corn hugging snp500 going down the abyss  wen gym  yup also no more vacuum cleaner collecting btc from the market  tbh reading her tweet made me wanting to block her too  yup im also reading some russianspeaking analysts and that seems to be a consensus  probably but still a downtrend  this is an incomplete chaup to jan 29    possible reasons  nonaccredited investors arent eager to buy their publicly offered gbtc at this price  increased selling from accredited investors realizing their premium  increased competition driving the demand elsewhere     not sure the pattern doesnt match their outflow      on the other hand despite still positive illiquid supply change has become less pronounced  hodlers has cut down on buying a bit   gt whats happening that we dont know about  rampant speculation and a complete disregard for fundamentals induced by the perception of money printing  but we do know that just too euphoric to recognize  covfefe  covfefe  is it a whale or a big pp   curve usdn pool for one  bullish on btc but theres an increasing chance that degrossing and the subsequent selloff will take crypto down with it  cash gang for a week  i mean its 60 apy ser  fat bad carbs good ideology emerged     im going to go ahead and just follow everyone there  awesome list from an industry veteran                  wow im in an amazing company thanks mate  absolutely  this is also something to keep in mind as a downside risk to the setup i described   no clue havent heard about it   but why it would be the most popular in the us if it had been banned in china  my initial tweet implied that it would be popular in china then it also doesnt mean that it becomes the most popular across all demographics  there is a proven method to make a book or other content popular in china  have it banned by ccp  bullish miners are selling now alright  this is miners position index mpivalues above 2 indicate most miners are selling  yesterday it hit 77    i think one of distinctive features of this bullrun will be the repetition of all the top signals of 1718  retail will be freaking out and dumping several times right into iron hands of institutionsfundscompanies which will carry on with the pump fomoing back in the retail  my thoughts as well  the market is pretty unstable right now so pretty much anything drastic can be the pin  i would say that high fees mean high demand which validates the purpose of any infrastructure but you probably know that already  brutal  peu it should be coupled with a complaining waiver  guess where all those poor suckers will go to when duped  thats right the sec    he didnt even mention you  theres also the final boss macro fud   yes but its accurate for old lp as its timebased theyre going to revamp it soon this setup gives the somewhat safe opportunity of entering the tbtc pool with sbtc renbtc or wbtc to enjoy not only the greater yield but also some arbitrage opportunity as this yield can drive the tbtc pools imbalance even further on the other hand this tbtc pools token has the biggest apy of all other curve pools in   some weekend alpha  tbtc is experiencing supply side crisis as its prohibitively difficult to get it organically in size  thats why its  pool is  unbalanced     sayhydra   i see your point but those arent mutually exclusive   agree an ideal algo stable coin should have many sinks with various risk profiles to lock upcut its supply so probably the correct answer wasnt to dismantle this gambling mechanism but building one more and recalibrating their rewards  admittedly dsd looks better on this pai dont think im allowed to express negative opinion on dip13 since i havent participated in its discussion but as much as i dont like it this is exactly what the governance without quadratic voting looks like    i like your narrative more than the shit ive just tweeted  snp500 unfortunately if coinbase is out of bitcoin it doesnt look like it on charts in this very moment  the coinbase premium is negative which suggests that theres selling pressure if anything  source     by letting people trade bullish on vix  its not a terribly bad idea to derisk a bit for a few days   in that case their communication was atrocious so they still deserve the backlash    honestly i expect to wake up any second shits surreal     unless he knew about elons bio nothing to see here sir    exactly those sophisticated players from wsb remind me degenspartan acing your quiz while posting hentai pretty good hentai admittedly  lfg  whatever funny man im staying rich if you think binance halting withdrawals is bearish you ngmi   nobody knows better than elon how to screw     was it hfsp in there too  papa musk comin nice play by mia khalifa  two rounds of engagement boost  on entering doge and on the loss porn with everyone dunking on her  for the cost of probably 1 invested in the coin  i think it will go down more  1 overprinting 2 no way to reduce supply anymore 3 terrible sentiment on algos in general  however all the people youve named in the initial tweet are working on delivering v2 and more integrations so its definitely not over  bitcoin will have fireworks either in feb or march  too many stars are lining up  cant wait when they discover based and badger  unhedge   unfortunately and probably not the bottom either  the real fee here is failed transactions  i say let them sell  were pretty comfortable here at 30k and we need someone to fomo back when were at 45k   3b assess if you are okay with holding any of the pools assets because you end up with the weakest if shit hits the fan   its the shill your bag to wsb season the great bitcoin transfer of wealth continues  left liquid outflows  inflows  025 wallets btc change right illiquid        nan  id even say that the wsb vs hedge funds dichotomy is false  wsb includes them the great bitcoin transfer of wealth continues  left liquid outflows  inflows  025 wallets btc change right illiquid outflows  inflows lt 025 wallets btc change  traders degens and random punters keep selling to hodlers  updated data source    everything nukes in the end  come to jesus man   just use ethereum ffs   congrats man history books will be written on the impact of robinhood democratizing options trading  defi enthusiasts should takes no  saylor keeps twapping  my bet is on the following scenario  1 retail exiting top is in 2017style dump  2 institutionsfundscompanies laying down the groundwork again  3 retail rejoining the rally it isnt like 2017 after all      i hope they will we can use some extra motivation for building censorshipresistant alternatives  but still hodlers are stacking     and poor  vanilla btc is like pure vodka  its drunk only by fanatics and russians  always be wrappin  confirmed by illiquid supply dynamics   no clue but 40k wasnt the top  consolidation and chop are ahead icymi my previous tweet on the illiquid supply change cha my feed is filled with fud on bitcoin topping and the repeat of the 2017 top scenario  well onchain data begs to differ  heres what illiquid supply dynamics looked like at the former top and what it paints now  hodlers were selling then but theyre accumulating this time    straight to jpm hands  gt 100m aum gt frog avatar   they did though just didnt succeed  yes while there still are people working on it   dsd is heading into the max pain territory thats something to be kept in mind too it isnt over but the probability of rescuing coupon holders before expiration has decreased dramatically  unless theres another dip coming that cancels coupon expiration altogether buys everyone a lambo and deliver 40 virgins in the afterlife   good point  not sure about it either as despite having some presence of strong hands those are also held by traders who might want to rotate their capital basically the name of the game now is to timely exit alts and move everything to btc before corn starts painting green 1k dildos again cas is lit    frogriarchy  nah she doesnt  most of the time we work with frog and crypto punk avatars and we couldnt care less about their gender country of origin etc  bringing gender into this ecosystem is either trolling or point blank sexist  crypto is inherently meritocratic  well otoh covid will actually be over some day  thats so 2019 maam were all just apes here and dont do those old school gender things anymore  can confirm    is this a guy  whatever im not evolving love it that way  have fun staying sapiens  be careful though this chadoesnt imply that weve bottomed  haha yeah  they definitely look like theyre enjoying their work  all of these sound like a personal opinion theres more to it mate voting on layer 0 doesnt require any token   why  heres the full methodology   tldr an entity is illiquid when the ratio of the cumulative outflows and cumulative inflows over the entitys lifespan lt 025  heres the full methodology   tldr the ratio of the cumulative outflows and cumulative inflows over the entitys lifespan lt 025 if i had to pick a single btc chato track daily my alltime favourite would be the illiquid supply change chait tracks inflows and outflows of bitcoin to hodler addresses  as you can see its at ath the last two weeks  were in huge consolidation   its at 45 exactly because they made that decision if they joined others dsd would be in expansion now   old data   reaction to dip13 passing same as with esd  i think they are have a fighting chance with v2   i have an important message for the people that were dumping dsd today to prevent expansion benefitting everyone   dumping it while the other whales were courageously marketbuying it  have fun staying poor   well they can have fun staying poor then  what else is interesting here is that the price of esd has understandably tanked since implementing this innovation               its  this tx still smells hentai  im too focused on btc right now but will happily tweet about them when i have one  i wish i could answer this question but i cant as it heavily depends on your risk profile  however i would recommend bonding only after coupons are redeemed dsd is getting sent dip13 dsd proposal to make the half of coupon capital redeemable seems to going to be passed  i wouldnt be surprised to see massive inflow to coupons similar to esd now that dsd is closer to expansion and the risks of owning coupons is halved  besides onchain metrics i really like tracking social signals  for instance take a look on the engagement stats of my recent tweet on dsd  im in it for the community is the new im in it for tech  its boiling and i expect fireworks soon   while the candle is similar the structure of the market is very different to what we had in 2017 coalition of dsd whales has bought out the biggest bear the community had  defi keeps surprising me not a single boring day   thats the only chawe need to track everything else is noise  chad  a wick to get you liqd and make you rekt   tongue twister   hes stopped hacking defi protocols and switched to the bigger fish  my bias changes with facts im not married to any point of view  oh shit i sold corn and got twice as much usdt thanks    if you call dips every day some day you will be right   we have to sacrifice sassal for the greater good woke up to the feed filled with desperation on btc  just wanted to remind you that while retail is scared shitless the  train keeps chugging along  8762 btc acquired in the last 24h  hfsp   the thing is the amount of money that play against them is wellknown and limited by dsds float and potentially the amount coupon will print on the other hand the amount of money the whales have is hard to estimate but the caliber of  the players looks very promising  dsd is a meme factory  word if you thought whales will let their coupons expire without a fight you underestimate how much money those people have  were going beyond 1  one should not underestimate the cornered coupon whale   confucius   im not an expeon the us politics but  should fire some of her advisors  they make her look severely uninformed   nice shroomplate      didnt respect ze bump enough  julien is useful indeed i would even say that he was instrumental to  formation you think someone is a true datadriven expeand then they post a take so cringey youre like omg how have you even managed to larp so long  here  grayscale casually bought 16k btc in 24h this week is going to be spectacular   looks like  now do the costs of running a bank  altogether with their shenanigans  altogether with corrupt governments   i believe the human ingenuity that is dao will find some ways to counteract it  or the demand increases  or something else happens  people are creative this guy really gets the dynamic   your donation to the upcoming btc pump is greatly appreciated sir  sir tether is really important for fudding bitcoin when one has missed the pump but still wants to enter the game have fun staying rich institutions    i wonder how many of alerts like this are just transactions between an exchanges hotcold wallets with one of them being undetected  hope so if apple budges and removes telegram i will make sure to never use any product of this company     balls of steel indeed  eth all time high tomorrow or im having fun staying poor  well ive already done my pamaybe will even increase the position  not sure yet  new sanctions ahead  also great point thanks  esd doesnt have 50m under the sword of damocles  good point guys theres an important proposal ahead dip13 and i believe its good to measure emotional sentiment on it as well  please for representativity  a  coupon expiration is a devastating even that will kill dsd  b  changing the rules when times got tough is unacceptable       awesome nomination love this guy         lots of familiar and reputable names love yall    no since i lost about 2 btc on bitmex back in 2018 i never do any leveraged play  just slowly increasing my position still have some bullets left in case its not obvious were only getting 20k btc if macro shits the bed  were in full blown consolidation scrap that 20k bera charts and chill  yes if we were in 2017  now most people will just switch to another stable coin i wish someone made a movie about a dsd top drama that is about to unfold   whether coupon holding whales will succeed in saving their capital is to be discovered  but what you can expect with a pretty high probability is an attempt to get back to 1  tick tock    the gbtc train is unstoppable  with every btc dip they double down on acquisitions  time to be leverage shoberas we need fresh blood to break that 40k ceiling    what should one do if they dont care about ethereum  inb4 having fun staying poor  tis but noise  it depends on your definition of subscription service with on chain analytics then  all im saying is the services like nansen is here to stay and you cant built this with just onchain analytics its always about proper intelligence  any decent subscription service with chain analytics includes all the things you named and much more  this is how this business is done we dont have to like it but its here  sorry but i cant see how publicly shaming alex is helpful here   by the way im sure there will be some users actively pursuing being labeled  psyops and clout can be powerful tools and nansen is on its way to become another marketing channel  i believe its not about fun theres a strong demand on such services  whether we like it or not condemning it on twitter or not  this is what people and businesses want  im sure if some person is unhappy about being tracked all they have to do is ask to be removed  gotta ask my autonomic nervous system  the main difference is that the 2017 drop happened in summer and it was retail but 2021 drop happened at the beginning of the year and institutions have a clean slate and are hungry for risk   there might not be the second dip at these levels as it was back in 2017  surprised they didnt say russian telegram could yield them much more views  all three days of   wow i absolutely love her voice  please make a separate thread for all the trades she took thats super interesting    still superior to whatsapp uiwise tho    some proprietary software  why people always make the same mistake  if a model is good it doesnt mean its applicable to all cases around    weird feeling yeah have to sit on my hands to avoid the reflex of dumping daily on yall   i will never emotionally recover from this    lololol    aye sir anything for education  true im also a proponent of increasing the demand not reducing the supply  i like what  is doing for esd in that regard  maybe theres also a persongroup working on integrations for dsd as well  i want this  not yet still working on it  estsla ftw  its an internal dashboard  i dont have a strong opinion on this but a counter argument is  1 expired coupons is a terrible but expected outcome theres nothing outoforder here everyone knew its always on the table 2 in dsds case the float will become much lighter making getting back to 1 easier the ultimate game will be empty set tesla  this roller coaster would be incredible  one of my favourite technique when i was learning written mandarin was image googling a character in addition to looking it in a dictionary  that way you can catch some extra subtle connotations the character usually has  eg heres 外围 from todays doveys  tweet  no more shorting allowed  wow price has caught the infinite bids treatment once again  its over for bears that was th  no xrp to avoid being fucked twice  incorrect expired coupons is exactly the consequence of the project working correctly   you see coupons arent free money there is always risk so when this risk is realized is it really a shocker  as per losing trust in the system please refer to my initial tweet  can you elaborate more on why its wrong not sure i follow  apes   you can risk manage by reducing your position  well it depends on the project i guess why would they move from dsd if a lot of dsd is burned by expired coupons i dont have a strong opinion here tbh  yup my thoughts too   well theres a proposal to unburn the principal on coupons expiration so technically its never really burned but locked instead what is burnable is the interest   saying that expired coupon holders will never buy coupons again is exactly like saying that liquidated traders will never use leverage   both will but with better risk management   thats correct but neither me nor  didnt argue with it wrong thread  1 coupon expiration means that the project works as intended coupons arent free lunch   2  inflows into crypto doesnt necessarily translate to inflows to dsd  3 real community decimator is a lot of supply preventing going back to 1 eg esd  what makes you think that one exceptionally good ios developer is looking to switch industries and dive into crypto  worked with her closely now your team has a chance too  her cv    to little sleep lol  thanks for the catch   upd wrong esd chaheres the correct one   can be but with reduced supply it becomes much more attractive for whales to buy up dsd exchange them for coupons pump the price with little to no resistance at 1 and book nice profits i think we will see those dsd coupons expiring because even if the whales will try to pump the price to trigger expansion dsd holders will meet them at 1 dumping the price back to 08  but its up to the whales as its impossible to detect how much dry powder they have left technically eip16 could be implemented in dsd as well but i really doubt that dsd holders will vote it in as its in their best interest to let the coupons burn decreasing the supply esd looks much worse as there still are only 84m coupons to expire negligibly reducing the supply  however there is also eip16 in the works which will make coupon principals unburnable  this will make esd coupons more attractive theoretically reducing the supply greatly  lets talk about esd and dsd coupons  dsd coupons is something to behold with two waves of expirations epoch 721749 and 756767  up to epoch 767 there are 78m coupons to expire which represent 53m dsd with a 45 premium  there are also 4m more coupons after epoch 767   not touching this shit until they implement seigniorage and coupons  i put fear in my milkshake   im not sure why i havent blocked you already  maybe its your unique ability to delusionally make up stories only you can believe in   or your complete inability to feel social dynamics and being a heavy liability to curve  either way dont change dude     sure its challenging but thats the rules of the game to be fair i understand uniswaps resentment its just that forkshaming wont fly well in this community     well it kind of did but there were a loophole     you can chose more a restrictive license like  did  admittedly this way you wont get the admiration of people for being generous but at least you wont look like a complete hypocrite when trying to protect your work from stealing  you can have either attention and free labour that come with open source or protection from copying  you cant have both  forking ftw  love those tweets keep em going pls what first timers and newbies dont realise is that the grizzled veterans of crypto past are dead inside they feel nothi  stay poor or have fun staying poor  i mean that looked like   was preaching celibacy amidst a huge gang bang as  was approaching him with a kingsized black dildo ready to put it to work  he saw it coming  fiat investors should be prepared to lose all their money bitcoiners warn nan  there are already some good epoch tracking apps out there eg   probably its better to focus on tracking coupon dynamics now as its still a pretty murky area just btfd with gt 1m btc  now back to crunching data on dsd and esd  also touch my tweet on your screen with one of these wine glasses itll turn it into proper vodka  if this is mayo under the caviar throw this blasphemy away immediately   unfortunately no other algo except esddsd matches my investment thesis yet but zai looks interesting  tbh it reminds me of huge unlocks in dsd everyone was afraid of  we know what happened then the price skyrocketed   sam is right highly anticipated negative  and positive just look back to the btc last halving  events turn out to be nothing at best shortterm  с рождеством  dsd coupons elasticoins are all the rage this days so an option play on one of it seems like a good opportunity 1 the euphoria is intoxicating but crypto is in need of a pullback and consolidation if btc wants to reach into the 100 even the smartest people and funds of ct can accidentally share something like this  this is how our internal db of know addresses grows bigger and bigger  the tweet with that image has been deleted not gonna dox the person    lololol nice one      nice app btw   haha my wife is a swift dev so its always around me too  sounds familiar what worked for me was rediscovering the old hobbies of mine like programming  i ended up building analytics for crypto anyways and making more money but every time i fire up vscode i feel joy  getting out of bed became much easier too  oh and more sleep   lets boycott ethereum  downshiftingdoneright    when i lived in crimea there was a classical violinist living one floor beneath me   every evening she was on her balcony playing everything from bach to the medley from the pirates of caribbean  good old lady  sounds pretty stable   you can use trading and otc channels on esd and dsd discords one more thing about both esd and dsd  every goto1dumpfromit cycle locks more and more tokens to coupons so with every pump we get closer to breaking 1  the strategy of buy lt 08 sell gt 095 works well until it doesnt robbing you of expansion rewards  hodl pays  gt watch the price of coupons in the secondary market  one of my favourite metrics as well  yes makes perfect sense  good strategy but you never know when one or two benevolent whales will make demand so strong that other whales prefer to hodl instead of unloading at 1  economically it makes a perfect sense to hodl as they will enjoy a better price and less slippage due to the pools size  strong demand as always although its unpredictable so nothing is guaranteed yeah dsd dumps at 1 will persist until whales are  1 sure twap stays gt 1 2 sure no other whale will dump at 1 3 finished derisking from the previous cycle 4 out of bullets  1 and 2 is a coordination game 3 and 4 is a patience game   either way 1 is on the table   coingecko bug   no way udi hadnt bought this domain before starting his effoof reminding poor people to enjoy their situation  yes but only due to the elasticoin trend  вам тоже удачи в новом году  фильм прекрасен вчера как раз посмотрел только  haha yeah  teriberka murmansk oblast   the home of the leviathan movie sorry for not being not responsive in dm will be back to keyboard soon   here is the arctic ocean northern russia not gonna lie ive seen warmer weather    the only explanation i can think of is that he tried to trigger an algo selloff and pick up some blood but played himself as a result  dude just got bored on holidays     will look into it thanks and it gets picked up almost immediately lol  tx  whale has just unloaded 12mm dsd pushing the price down to 069  things are starting to get interesting  tx   just those theyve got a lot of attention dsd seems to be cooling down a bit and has left the 851 range  could be just another forks drawing attention from it but some whales sold at 85 which has somewhat contributed to bearish outlook   be cautious and happy holidays  nice fud dude   since you clearly cant tell dsd from esd and dont understand the reasons behind some decisions im just gonna wish you a happy new year and a good entry point  hold on we have a lot of loweffoalgo stable coin forks over here  haha yeah  true but probably theyll want to derisk partially   its a joke mate  just like the original tweet ive never owned xrp cheap usdn again guys   yeah the interview was pretty interesting will probably make a thread on this  good decision probably but we all know already that dynamics in algo stable coins is full of surprises  i wouldnt worry theres plenty of time   ah yes  i meant longterm saw some people on twitter calling it a fad which i disagree with  maybe not the current design but its possible to get it right in the upcoming iterations   absolutely people tend to forget that we are in a highly experimental field with extremely high mortality rate  smateam doesnt necessarily translate to success there are a lot of other factors at play  the validity of the concept macro black swans  the demise of any project is always on the table no exceptions i promised a brief take on esd situation  well there still are large upcoming withdrawals ahead which is going to inevitably translate to some selling pressure  but despite some peoples opinion the caliber of the people behind esd affords it a decent chance of survival         gave it a very brief look didnt have time unfortunately   ui is great though  i also dont understand why people arent buying the future of finance which is xrp  secaccumulating   g is balls deep in dsdesd confirmed since the last tweet  dao stagedfrozen 23678258  15827777 33  the price is still in the range 085100  whales are taking profits from the last cycle stronger hands are buying classic consolidation    stable money printer  np back at 1 already its fascinating to see how the unlocked funds that was supposed to be dumped are getting locked back in contracts   in case it isnt obvious last several hour weve been in a textbook consolidation phase  stagedfrozen dao funds has dropped from about 30mm down to 23mm  i hope you have managed to build some position in dsd because were at 1 and the train is about to leave the station   lol fair im once again asking you to stop adding liquidity do the dsd uniswap pool   you guys do understand that the bigger pool the more it takes to move the price right   you dont except uniswap fees  honestly with that level of demand i dont think that this cap is too significant dsd coupons have pierced through 50mm  what do u think of this meme i created  btw looks like dsd is gonna claim back 1   very interesting to watch haha  usdcdsd pool on uniswap has the biggest volume and is the most profitable  ethusdt is the distant second   yes will comment on it soon too  totally that was spectacular defi never stops surprising love that space so dsd repeats its cycle  dao sells its mined rewards but the price is still rising to match the demand  i believe its only a matter of time when we break 1 when it happens all dry powder dao has left will be sent back to dao  its a cliche but gradually then suddenly     yup the more exchanges delist xrp the more profitable for others trading this asset becomes  xrp is dogshit but people want to trade it the demand is still here at least for the time being  you think its going to 03 what is really happening right now is whose huge withdrawals are being  and likely will be  sold at the 0709 range  these screenshots was made 30 mins apalets see if buyers can absorb it and then some  usdcdsd is the second highest pair by volume on uniswap  the power of apes  as it becomes customary dsd exceeded demand expectations  the holders that was withdrawing the huge amount of liquidity have chosen not to sell at least for now  some of them have bought coupons  also no whales sold me dsd at 03 i had to use uniswap but a man can dream  1 we are two epochs away from 35m dsd unbonding from the dao    does this mean 35m of selling pressure is   like his huge premine tfw you want to enter a position and everyone thinks youre shillin   man i love defi will try it thanks  thanks looks great  is there some article i can read on how it works im concerned about privacy mostly  got frontrun by the horde of apes  right i should probably get some sleep just to set some resistance level on dsd for the upcoming huge withdrawals i will happily buy up to 3000000 dsd at the price of 3 usdc  minimum trade size is 300000 dsd  no fee quick execution  lets keep some of these selling whales off uniswap  yes i like 3s  can you sir stop hacking   its a custom script not published yet things are about to get interesting for both esd and dsd communities  in two epochs on epoch 349 there will be a huge withdrawal of 30mm esd  for dsd folks it provides a good proxy of what can happen when their own two large dao withdrawals will be on the market   absolutely  usdtusdctusdbusd coexist just fine despite all of them having the same mechanics and usdt being the dominant player  dsd is more entertaining due to faster epochs and bigger swings  i see some people underestimate esd and that is a mistake imo  i think everyones waiting for those two large withdrawals to pass and after that will be a surge of demand people asked me yesterday how many community members esd and dsd share  while its hard to translate it to people we can take a look at the number of addresses that have interacted with both token contracts  esd 5358 dsd 6006 intersection 1693  pretty different communities  great app keep it up  that token represents your share of the total dao pool  there is no market for them yet but probably will be in the future  love your bio mate  love the shrooms so were entering dsds most difficult zone  nobody has the crystal ball to know how it will play out  whats your bet   pytnon and web3py  i dont think the price will go below 02503 because few people is willing to pawith a 1 stable coin at this price also the pools size is shrinking more likely the liq from these epochs will be the sword of damocles for the further epochs i love how instead of selling withdrawals are used for coupons and buying dsd instead  1 is closer than people think  my pleasure mate   no way esd withdrawals look heavy more selling pressure and coupon fuel to come  absolutely outsized 29mm dao withdrawal on epoch 359 heavy 17mm lp principal withdrawal steady pressure from lp claimers as well  i hope yall have hands stronger than ones of the gym friend  lp in dsd are out of bullets  both claimables and principal withdrawals become almost negligible  withdrawals from dao have also subsided in the later epochs  due to reduced selling pressure from lp theres a decent chance that we see 1 before those dao withdrawals mature   plot twist those candles are red little known fact  if you buy coupons earlier you will have an earlier exit   well we have already seen how fast the situation can change demand is too strong  yeah i too see interest from funds looking at questions in my dms lol  absolutely and i have a feeling that we will be at 1 faster than many expect  yes but taking into account that the entire design of this token is built to return to 1 and the community is full of apes the opportunity cost is pretty high it will be real fun if we blaze through 1 before those two monster dao epochs they chose to remain in dao and all the people on sidelines waiting for the dump end up buying above 1 catapulting us even higher than the last time   absolutely  thats hard to tell as it really depends on demand   however many people  me included  have underestimated the strength of the buyers so technically there could be no 9 resistance at all   lets see though the next 510 epochs will be super interesting to watch  unfortunately its still a paof my internal analytics but ill try to post it more often  yes whats interesting is that theyre supposed to be scared and selling but apes are apes and apes have no fear i must be honest i didnt expect that dsd buyers will consume all the selling and be asking for more  barring two monster withdrawals from dao which can easily rebond and disappear the sky looks clear and sellers seem to be out of bullets  1 and beyond seem likely    i hate this game deleted it 2 times and its still on my phone  here   i think  can help here   im relatively new too but both project are super young so theres plenty of time to get up to speed  ah i see youre a man in search of a better entry point as well  kremlin gangs back at it again  its a script from my internal analytics suite not published yet i guess you saw something else  yes and thats heavily depends on the price the closer its to 1 the more selling we should expect and vice versa  gonna try and collect data on that too very interesting  its a custom script but im working on a web app for esd after that i think im switching to dsd   yes that will be super interesting to watch  not good unfortunately  dsd withdrawals dont look good  besides permanent selling pressure from lp there are some monster withdrawals from dao on epoch 395 and 396  i hope you either have exited long before or have iron hands  heads up esd is about to endure increased selling pressure  immediate wave from lp epoch 343364 followed by a wave from dao epoch 349356  lets see what the demand will be like but my bet is on  plunge below 1   not yet working on it takes a bit more time than in expected  or youre just hodling them until there are enough integrations and liquidity   dao was never supposed to be a shortterm play  just querying the smacontracts directly  just in algo stable are so good affords you traveling back in time  yup some may choose to hodl instead  its just a script havent been published yet  tbh ive never came around to dig into them will probably do it after the holidays  i have a full node on the same server i run onchain analytics scripts on and i have never been happier and more productive  heres a good explanation   the epoch number under fluid denotes the epoch when the value in dsd next to it will become withdrawable  the buyers will definitely come but im a bit pessimistic here because the supply will be exceeding that of esd when it was at 1  i think this is a good and prudent strategy i sold some but dont mind keeping the rest putting it to work on sushiswap or bsd    yup well its pretty obvious by now that the selling pressure is going to be relentless  the only question now is how long we will be staying under 1  quick reminder the epoch number under fluid denotes the epoch when the value in dsd next to it will become withdrawable   thanks didnt know that  no clue havent been following the project for a while sorry dsd farm looks good too  one more farm for esd sushiswap onsen  at the moment it yields even more than dao with no lockups  the apy is going to drop soon though    starting epoch 359  dsd selloff incoming    5 days for dao 1 day and 16 hours for lp  nice chawhere is it from   3 days for dao a small update on lp principals and claimables withdrawal  epoch 364 is going to be hard almost 10mm dsd to be sold  also selling pressure is still steady in the upcoming epochs if those numbers dont recede were heading to a massive selloff   in my opinion the whole dao play is about compounding as much as you can and make peace with the fact that youre gonna exit in the next expansion cycle at best dao is about longterm  this is a custom script not published yet heads up increased selling pressure in dsd incoming  from epoch 359 in lp claimables from epoch 360 in lp principals from epoch 383 in dao  that doesnt necessarily mean that a debt phase is near but increased selling pressure raises the odds of this event  stay safe   sure after im done with esd tracking app dsds next christmas dsd onchain transparency repoit turned out its pretty easy to adapt my esd script for tracking dsd as well  please note that it was a really quick and dirty poso take all the numbers with a grain of salt  they ought to be correct though  merry christmas   i just iterate through holder addresses and call fluiduntil on each  also i calculate the total unbonded fluid number separately just to be sure that they add up  this brought up memories of really bad good acid trip   to be fair he didnt make his money with the web site  on the other hand when youre in the saas industry a website is exactly how you make money  ui is important its just its not that important  you  should  also  try  this    ah those two  the total fluid and fluid by epoch  are calculated separately and always should be equal  thanks i dont have a public repo yet but i think i will make it in january  happy holidays  not at the moment but soon i will im just focusing on shipping the web ui first and will build on that then  honestly my hands are full with esd at the moment but i think when im finished and if dsd is still alive it would be very interesting to dig into it  sure ill get to that when ive shipped the app this code is a paof my analytics suite so disentangling it will take some time can you dm me your telegram so i can ping you when im done  yup pretty much it  columns metric  value  holders  share of parent node  bondedfrozen  fluid cant withdraw stagedfluid cant withdraw stagedfluidepoch available for withdrawal on that epoch  sounds interesting after shipping the app lets see what we can do with the code well have to run it on the same network as the node though due to lots of requests  as per the critical numbers i think they should be at least at 510mm each epoch to break the trend  yes it returns to the peg eventually being the king of the hill on coingecko is such an amazing marketing channel so i really really want it to last as long as it can many people that came for profit stay for something else like i did also i like the amount of attention were getting due to the skyhigh apr  it strengthens the community and consolidates our position as a dominant algo stablecoin  i hope that continues for a while todays esd transparency repoi must say im impressed the dips at the staof epochs arent just bought theyre devoured  at this level of demand even 3mm dumps isnt an issue smooth sailing as yesterday  ps i think i like the numbers and started to work on web ui     that entirely depends on two factors  1 when lp and dao members decide to unbond and withdraw  or  2 when there will be some structural change of the rules of the game  my analytics can somewhat help with the first but to predict the second people need to follow the community   until theres esd there all those are smol pp apes  what fluid bit do you mean  it seems like you track the amount of bondedunbonded value on a given day my stats track the absolute values and theyre calculated by iterating through holder addresses and calling corresponding methods on sc as opposed to tracking events  it depends on what they consider unbonded if you still have that data we can look into it  i think ill be able to ship a web app within a week it will be a bit easier than trying to decouple the code from the rest of my suite im fed up with low quality clickbait in crypto  so i decided to suppowhile they arent perfect they a    sure let me know when i should provide the points   esd 426mm     if you know the basics of working with web3 ie can query smacontracts and process the results sure  being able to programmatically collect all addresses that have interacted with dsd token smacontract would be a good start   i think eventually well get to that  as i said  im happy to advise anyone who is willing to built it as the cost of doing it myself would be prohibitively high due to the opportunity cost of having to switch attention from the project where my capital actually is such strong demand isnt a surprise since esd is 1 defi farm on coingecko both by tvl and yield  asset that yields 3100 apr just cant be cheap  by the way  wen esd in farms  your daily esd onchain analytics update  the outlook remains very bullish  no large withdrawals  all selling pressure isnt just been absorbed nicely the demand actually outweighs the supply  nb ive added a number of holders column next to the value for every parameter   thanks im working on tracking more parameters and as soon as its productiongrade ill immediately staon working to ship it as a web app or some other app update on esd  the situation has improved considerably  1 the huge dao withdrawal on epoch 338 has disappeared 2 demand is much stronger than lp dumping their rewards 3 withdrawals from both dao and lp has decreased in the forthcoming epochs  have at it apes   it indicates the share the item takes in its parent node for the firstlevel nodes its share of the total supply  yeah this will be fun to watch i dont have any tracking algos for a debt phase yet so will be focusing on that  i think the dip will be bought up pretty quickly though just a gut feeling ps since people are asking this is my onchain analytics and its not publicly available now but im working on it  ps2 of course im bullish on the project its just i believe were entering a debt phase which is perfectly normal to the people bullish on the price of esd im afraid were going down soon  1 steady increase in withdrawals from dao starting from epoch 328 2 massive outflow from dao on epoch 338 3 increase in lp taking profits starting on epoch 327 4 cool 3 mil in bsd ready to dump  cc  people like this are exactly the reason why being an unpaid volunteer contributing to a dao is hard  my message to anyone blaming the team vc and others for their own financial mistakes is the same its always been  enjoy being rekt    no lock up period i guess    it takes two things to drive the price below 1  1 instant hit by 2 mil sitting in basis dollar contracts 2 slow downward pressure by increased dao withdrawals starting with epoch 328  after that no more new participants from coingecko and a downward spiral from there a little recap of what happened at the void last week  rise of the empty apes        future  money is not real until you can touch it  gt liquidation fund  ah famous bullish selling some whales have exited  pool on  usdn and its hugely imbalanced now  so if you have usdcusdt and always wanted to enter this pool theres a premium for doing that now  the total yield is around 35 not too shabby either   take a look  pro tip when you decide to sell your btc make sure you exited to usdc as you will end up in esd farm anyway one of the best opsec measures ive adopted is memorizing the first 2 and the last 2 digits of all the smacontracts i interact with and clicking that trezor button only after i verified whats on the screen can we all agree if

100 monthly thereafter  which is actually less than my previous setup on digital ocean by the way do has implemented nvme storages as well but the cost is prohibitive and hetzner is more performant anyways   so this time we will be using a ex62nvme hetzner server with an additional 2tb storage  please note that ive picked this setup because the node will be sharing the server with our app so its better to use a separate ssd for the blockchain and not be too cheap on the cpuram  ive decided to up my game a bit and use a much recommended nmve ssd storage coupled with a powerful cpu and a plenty of ram  however we still need to stay on budget to properly answer the question if an ethereum full node can be set up and maintained rather cheaply ethereum full node syncing diary 2020  so this is high time for my yearly an  node syncing attempt  the infura debacle coincided with our need for a new node server and i will try to make better choices of hardware this time  kudos for  for the genre  1n    thats how i imagine g looks like after hearing his voice   you can always pretend that youre just comfortable in stablecoins like i cope do  investors  so youre telling me when im doing 5 market buy i aint get to own the devs what a scam     theres always the middle ground here like investors realizing that the project is dead without devs and actively trying to motivate them  the btc vs eth people either troll  which is fine and fun  or still cant see the forest behind the trees  not your node not your infra  let us just say he is a big fan of the mediterranean cuisine  140 effective pinky promise  looks like something    could offer  i mean why not were trained to ape into unaudited contracts  direct injections of pure bitcoin ftw  newparadigm  t h e r e i s n o s p o o n    also devs miners and marketers  never less than 100 you either have a conviction or havent done enough research  once a degen always a degen  everything in moderation including moderation   as long as his personal goals are aligned with crypto im okay with sam being selfish btc eth and defi tokens are starting to trade fairly differently   probably good to figure out what you understand the

speculate on the fact that he has started preparing his postterm immunity from prosecution plus the comments from some obscure person  it can be anything but i dont believe that the grandpa is out any time soon i grew up in russia we dont really have the election     join us for the glorious onedigit apy  the correlation between poor performance in life in general and getting easily offended probably is extremely high too   not bad but can be better   ive sampled every language english is my favorite fantastic language   bullish   gt having fun  so either everyone will be winning or its a perfect cocktail for a nice shosqueeze on dxy the ruble pair shows weakness too  1 usd  8057 rub 1 usdt  from 8044 rub all the way down to 68 rub  source      sleeper in my case i slept through both

find time to take a look at it then   sorry had to redo a reply because of the typo  how is it so far is it worth a read  while were wasting our time on twitter these unsung heroes work on mainstream

i wish he replied   this is  before he quit ct a call for anyone who has ever farmed swerve w boosts to please vote  we need less than 8 to reach quorum we humbl  the future we deserve expect things to get very noisy next week given high odds of a contested election and europe in the process of locking do   he stopped having fun because his btc bag made him rich   id quit too     lets drop the other shoe already  what if  is   bitcoin surging again the decoupling ethbtc to zero  15  i know many people will disagree with this thesis because embracing mediocrity is hard  this pill becomes much more palatable when people understand that we do not have to excel in everything  giving up your ambitions on something means that you get to focus elsewhere  second this  cc     it depends on what doing means im still paof swerves community but as an lp im protocolagnostic as an investor i hold only stable coins at the moment  theyre going to wake up regulators tbh   true never a dull day in the us politics  i have no idea why i do this either but its almost daily  im not even american ffs   good point   regulators can attack anyone they can reach who has interacted with the smacontracts  the walls of our little casino arent as tough as many think  regulatory action against major dexes is incoming  would be interesting to see how the unstoppable contract hypothesis holds up y pool on  has mad liquidity utilization of 2647 due to the attack on harvest finance    on the other hand as an lp i farmed a shitload of sushi and dumped it at 3 5 and 128   the holders well i hope eventually they will break even   thinking about getting google pixel just to test it out and to use a trezor with it  its 2020 and we still cant use a trezor with ios wtf   as the most vulnerable pais people it will pay to be as mobile as possible having more than one citizenship and making sure it isnt the us helps too  i would say yes  regulate and gradually strangle is much more safer politically than just a ban  banning it outright looks terrible as they seem to care about being perceived as innovation friendly   unfortunately this protection isnt free      mandatory joke about  and trouser snakes  you might have some progress here but we both know who has real supah powah      why does vyper look so sexy huge whale withdrew 79000000 worth of liquidity from uniswap usdtusdceth pools and put stable coins into values seed contract to farm while keeping the eth in the wallet  somebodys really convinced that were going to moon and wants to avoid il     to have a chance for another pump we need some new narrative for defi as governance and future dividends is a tough sell these days bigger picture defi is not dead it will eventually resume its 2way high beta behavior vs btc im thinking it will r   sir are we talking smoothie   all i know is that there are much more moving parts now than in 2017 so im flat for at least two weeks no matter what after that im following the trend whatever it will be   who knows bitcoin is full of surprises i mean most people expected alts to retrace yesterday when btc drew that 1k candle   i wonder if alts will follow when btc really takes off like ripping through 20k happy traders means optimistic traders   optimistic traders means we have a chance to drag that farmer party a little longer  as a cash gang i sincerely wish you punters amazing returns on your bets  go btc rip it baby   the elections hasnt happened yet its too early to make conclusions  im ready to be wrong though as i benefit either way  same for being an open finance maxi fam  it will get better until it gets much worse when btc obliterates alts on the next leg up   they really need their usdt lol incredible demand for usdt driven by the btc pump has soaked up usdt liquidity both on  and   at the moment curves usdt pool yields 75187 apy   thats fresh and viral but drama wins views consistently  yeah i liked salty maxis better tbh feeling comfy in usdc   bitcoin breaks 12k good some stablecoin liq will be out of my farms chasing pump more apy for me  dumps massively also good will stasliding in some fav tokens  either way not diving into this retard market until were way past the elections  300x btc long target 20k got it funding secured  true but i like theease of deploying capital into it and exiting back almost no slippage on major exchanges  bitcoin vs alts profiting from both   everyones aping into the pool attracted by the mta subsidy  lets give it a day or two and reassess the utilization again  staying poor is a way of having fun  congrats    ok not the exact moment as the code needs to be updated and redeployed but still    it is a definite thing but it entirely depends on a very democratic consensus the moment the consensus decides there is 100m btc now the definite thing changes   someones built a model   tldr bundling and selling baskets made of different yield strategies grouped by the level of risk  on the other hand as a founder you have deeper insights into your industry as well as more opportunities to discover adjacent niches  i guess vc vs founder is really about whether you are comfortable having less control over your investments or prefer more active approach hey  me and other degens are gonna ape into  tonight so it would be nice if you kept an eye on it and froze the hackers asses in case it gets hacked  i mean that would definitely make people more comfy holding usdc in general  much love  ask him if the amount of virgins per man drops as good men enter the paradise the way apy drops when more liquidity joins a pool  or if the total virgins in circulation is uncapped  we need to figure it out before making a decision of joining such a binding religion havent looked into  since the 2017 ico craze but the usdn development prodded me to dive into it  impressive really impressive  the quality of the uiux interoperability and gamification is well beyond

ethereum 20 miners for mev is the most powerful bull case for eth  nah the best casino is the most abstract casino as long as the game seems easy enough to the average joe to grasp a casino works just fine  to link shillers dont this isnt it in what is surely news to no one  study finds that  antimoney laundering policy has less than 01 impact on financial cri   thats a really controversial decision  not only there will be one more language to learn  with unclear benefits  but this also increases the surface auditing firms will need to cover  this is exactly how we usually end up with 10 languages with 100 frameworks for them   beep beep freedom of speech and expression has to be guarded freedom of submitting governance proposals has to be guarded right to  bitcoin is a salty maxis generation machine and ethereum is a defi lambo ponzi generation machine   just my 2 cents maam  why not mock them clearly they havent learnt anything the previous n times   if disclaimers didnt do it so maybe public humiliation saves the next wave of irresponsible gamblers  so far all i can see is that losing money and playing a victim become quite fashionable  capital reputation and network come with age hence decreased risk appetite and the inclination to conserve  always said this lets do mysql instead   both in belarus and russia the police is a selfserving gang that needs to be cancelled disbanded and prosecuted  nice blueberries   send it don  a note on the future of swerve    drink home be selfsufficient  np just dont dilute the yield fam  yeah super scam stay away   tokyo is

thing  cancelled  stunning and brave  good riddance your monthly reminder that a pool is as safe as its weakest asset  dont like at least one asset in it ignore the whole pool the real fight is not bitcoin vs ethereum shitcoins or whatever the real fight is open access decentralization unbiased  good point   i wonder if circle will offer some bridge here though this event would be a major turning point for them  i think that main beneficiaries of this event will be other stablecoins because usdt is so entangled into the whole ecosystem that its demise will lead to a devastating systemic catastrophe affecting all volatile assets including btc  15 week on average  about 6 auditing firms had answered our call 3 weeks ago when were trying to get swerves contracts audited   on the other hand around 10 firms declined due to overload  just some stats  now lets see if the market can devour tether going down  here have a tea  daddys back turn down the music a bit  how to actively contribute in dao  1 do nothing 2 if someone tries to do something oppose 3 keep opposing until ever would love to see   rebranding to just y at some point  it is hard to think of a shorter and more expressive umbrella brand for all its products  and no this little dump means nothing lol   long live y  can confirm people couldnt care less about infrastructure   but crypto is filled with engineers so to them it seems that other people are as excited about tech as they are  shocker but a userfacing product is whats important to users   fwiw im an engineer hey  what do you guys think about integrating   you already have curve so doing us should be pretty much ctrlc ctrlv  awesome app by the way keep up the good work    but idk though might be psyops  ethereum is an empire  single currency military and rich economic activity science within it it currently spins off coup    lol yeah a kilo of jam and a kilo of shit makes two kilo of shit when mixed     he is right though   i believe he has put cedefi in quotes to be used as a simulacrum   a simulacrum itself is real but yes theres nothing behind it  did this and my usdt has evaporated from the wallet halp  agree on this but all im saying is that the world is polarized enough already  if some countries are hostile to this movement there are a dozen of others that will happily host it  thanks for the great thread adam  i cant help but notice though that youre addressing not defi as the whole but defi for the us  defi  or open finance to be precise  doesnt need to comply with any regulations by definition the sip9 t5 community multisig holders has passed unanimously  now 3 community members    so where have we seen this   big banks fraud money laundering toxic securities abuses fined  crypto accepts american bullish for defi   team tether   now try to roll without troll there remember back in feb someone took out a 3m dydx flash loan and used  half of it to borrow wbtc from compound  the ot  also macro looks turbulent and will stay like this for a month or two  moved most positions to usdt and left them in smacontracts mining some shitcoins no il no volatility and greatly reduced sc risk since those are simple sc and its tether lol  feel comfy what happened this week  swerve dashboard coingecko defi listing tvl audit treasury amp multisig holders treasury promissory tokens tswrv reduce governance quorum setheth pools amp golden liquidity model  made by redarctic  pacificeth     the amount of lobbying the token holders of that protocol would endure will be impressive swerve dashboard with interactive tvl chaand other basic stats  check it out  gt  swrv   choosing china spying on me over the us any day    stay poor having fun guys   there is also a cohoof people like this guy   trump second term surge we have completed the security audit of swerve smacontracts and here is the final audit repo  to be fair theres also a small group of idealists indifferent to money the audit of swerve by  has finished and revealed no critical vulnerabilities  the full repowill be released soon from the official swerve account thank you      and  for agreeing to be our candidates  i cant stress enough that at  we dont have the team  everyone is the team   everyone can take on any issue or domain and become an insider possessing some valuable information   all you have to do is to offer something to the community the swerve ui has been understating the pool apy   has found that the onchain oracle forked yearns apyora  sir ive been thinking about mysql since i got to the space  reasonably sized brain  i mean i dont keep my mouth shut on the apy i get on stables but eh miners need traders to succeed not more miners  like we were waiting for almost a week for this halfassed cumshot major lol  this is not how you pump your crv bags dear  i believe some people are just confused what to be long and shovolatility means tbh we are willing to host a communitydriven livestream debate between  and    crv vs swrv ba             only if you promise to dump on us first   in the secs coffers as disgorgements  thanks   it did but not sure i follow about things being desperate  it was just an experiment bro hey  the community of swerve would love to see you as a nominee for our treasury multisig   would you like to be a candidate and voted on   true because i definitely said that it was me who recommended btc to them  tbh recommending btc to friends and family is exactly how you end up with neither counterpoint liquidity is a transient moat the only moat is brand and being top of mind   like b2c internet cos protoc   now thats something  vc mined token in open market and used it in governance   quick you dont want to miss it  mate for a guy relying on swerve as a coping mechanism for crv bagholding youre doing a terrible job on following our new developments  this proposal has passed with flying colors  still waiting for your thread on vc funding swerve  much love lt3  sip2 new governance proposal for admin fees to be redirected to treasury  the time to come together as a community is n when youre finally free to tell the whole truth  16 call for swrv locks amp future vote  swrv  we did some analysis on veswrvs voteescrowed swrv heres th  defi means i buy low and dump on everyone  bitcoin is defi  see easy  salty cope is salty  bulas still in charge  yeah timelock will work havent looked into the contracts deep enough tbh  perhaps it would help if you make the diffs with the original contract to highlight the differences and narrow the scope of audit yfvstyle   stablecoin seed pools is welcome too  you should probably remove all the minters from the token contract and burn its governance currently this fine gentleman 0x5b3f5b1bd47a30ceceac837b3cc75fabaab30ec2 can add minters  you dont dump on anyone  dumps on you     larry stahp       я теперь понимаю почему вам никто не отвечал в телеграмме доброй ночи       а кто эта команда и что конкретно она взяла от проекта  вот я к примеру взял 5k на аудит и 2 недели на бесплатную работу в течении которых я выслушиваю претензии типа ваших  кого конкретно вы имеете в виду под командой for our sip2 treasury vote we are currently sitting at 901 approval338k veswrv w 54 votes for minimal quorum would       у нас у всех диалог в дискорде складывается без проблем если формулировать запрос без претензий   насчет предложений всегда открыты но нужны люди кто предложения будет реализовывать   повторюсь проект нефинансируемый и команда  суть все коммьюнити       не кажется приходите к нам в дискорд и отвечайте работой вместе со всеми здесь все волонтеры никто никому ничего не должен    galaxy brain take  forks are just marketing vehicles for the original projects      не знаю кто такой ванс но если напишите егоее имя в оригинале загуглю      если по одной ошибке судить о команде поверьте о команде curve тоже можно много хорошего сказать но зачем нам эта соль  что касается вашего мнения я готов его уважать в других областях но вы не юрист насколько я знаю  и к чему этот fud про финансирование от vc      михаил атаки троллей идут с обоих сторон это твиттер насчет кражи вы тоже погорячились  мы же в парадигме опенсорс и проприетарность вашего кода нарушена не была просто это ограничение красиво обошли  что касается некомпетентности это тоже зря дискорд хаотичен всегда    пусть работает бесплатный маркетинг   bon appétit mate    jouliens tweet is more recent than mine but yeah it works too   well you have an opportunity to bring more fairness to the world  so far you have given zero facts just claims   in russian we call this kleveta enlighten us  cant wait for your thread on these revelations and the usual subsequent apologies shortly thereafter you know metamaskstyle   bro wait weve almost fixed it       always following your breaking news my man  omg some project on the internet is having operational issues quick lets tweet about it no way other projects like yfi had the exact same problem and had to lower the quorum threshold it seems that being a community project means no vc should be able to buy its token   may i ask you to do your masternode thing and ban all vc addresses from interacting with swrv token contract  ну позязя  a good question is how much of it is going to be consumed by arbitrageurs in a form of impermanent loss burns 675 of their total supply   but more interesting is that  now owns 77 of thei sip3 and sip5 have been enacted at  swusd pool the trading fee has reduced from 004 to 003 and the   this liquidity just like swerving back from curve and it wants to enjoy the process one more time wen binance wen audit is x good news wen vc why dump how much vc salary lex why suck huobi dick lex im builder you not lex       good catch the ceo of swerve is ready to offer you your job back just need a signature from the ceo of bitcoin      sir its crypto everyones a vc      since  just got fired you are entitled to his salary from nonexistent imaginary dev fund sir      that does it no more swerve salary from nonexistent dev fund for you      one more word and youre fired from swerve finance for substandard trolling     watch you mouth young man before  comes and teaches you some manners and a sense of humor token distribution  the top holder of swrv is  which has almost 3 times the amount  has  why  because binance let greed to take the best of them having listed swrv against bnb and busd pairs only  stats courtesy of amazing   balancers smapools are one of the most underappreciated primitives right now  in 3 hours swerves inflation will fall of a cliff ending the initial 2 week period of boosted swrv rewards  currently  whatever you want it to be come to our discord and steer the wheel something to keep in mind if youre too bullish on emission cut numba go up  this is an untested territory dyor   got it zero proofs new accusations  bro its time to stop posting and go to bed seriously thats enough twitter for today   mate you should really stop smokin that shit no offence  youre making strong statements and serious accusations mind back them up with something and please elaborate on advanced sneaky traps  by the way this is not the first time i see you spreading bs on twitter  dude youre just a troll on twitter making unsubstantiated accusations and picking fights all day  relatively low lol  wonder no more its exactly 5k i gave the project for the audit as we still dont have a dev fund  that crv bag must be heavy julien  ser you are welcome to bet your life savings on it  numba go up only chance to own a full swrv few  pick you poison     yes swerve is an experiment so anyone who wants to bet money on it should plan accordingly  anything can happen yeah but its gonna be a nice experiment     there may be a little lag but i think that its just some miners hasnt smashed that claim button yet  swrv is minted on claiming swrv is about to experience a 24fold decrease of the inflation  instead of 4500000 swrv issued per week there will be only 187500  while betting on the price please remember that the inflation is not the only factor at play here  countdown    they definitely can but i doubt it would be sustainable   you need money to develop a product and something has to give  this money can come from the community but the hostile fork wont attract many people it is almost impossible to penetrate great open source projects unless they make some critical mistakes   rub the community the wrong way fail to understand the trend and you lose your ground  open source is a huge moat so unless you shovel trash into it it serves you well   so much this   this gatekeeping behavior is simply unacceptable  people should have a right to get rugged wherever they please  just to give crypto folks a taste of what treasuries will become soon    less than 3 weeks     nansen is a superpower  still waiting for akidney and ckidney           would love to to have  on the list as well  looks great if you could also add an option to show pools without il and add  that would be awesome  no wonder russia is crushing it  i hope all centralized stables already have user suppolarge enough to handle all those cases this is a killer feature and a leverage against dai had a lot of fun working with  and   feels protected  to those concerned that binance listing didnt move swrv price  1 why are you focused on price so much lol  2 theyve listed the token against bnb and busd pairs only those arent known for deep liquidity  so their audience still have little idea about    i hope we will build a more sustainable source from the admin fee broke wen swrv on binance woke wen busd on swerve  i can agree with that wording most of them are indeed  did the same never looked back also cut loose all social networks except twitter my guilty pleasure  in our case it will take 35 personweeks they agreed to reveal that estimate as per an actual amount of people involved thats up to them but i really hope its more than one haha  its 35k nobody is perfect i guess as soon as two more multisig cosigners sign a prepayment transaction  is going to stathe audit  the prepayment will be seen as a transaction to transfer 17500 usdt on their wallet on binance yay we did it  we have collected 38000 to fully cover the audit   i feel blessed to be a paof this amazing community   thank you all  now its time to commence with the audit   immediately dumping the token they just mined doesnt imply being a good samaritan  thinking of lp as speculators is pretty much the same as thinking of bitcoin miners as traders some are some arent  nope i mean there is definitely some overlap but as long as the mineanddump strategy is still used those are different cohorts   some lp just cant be bothered to hold a token opting for immediately realize that sweet apy instead they are not speculating  i think you meant liquidity providers not speculators   the pot is shared among lp with speculators buying up what lp are mining  more speculators creating the demand and less liquidity mining the token make better apy          have any         our logo will look awesome in their styling just sayin  so as soon as i leave  youre in got it   everyone except beras beras are on a strict diet of salt and regrets       unfortunately they are not available right now and this is an urgent issue for us as were slowly climbing towards 1 bln    thanks disclaimer this is a community crowdfund and as laid out by sip8 all contributions would be treated as a zerointerest loan to the dao please see sip8 proposal for more details this is not a solicitation for investment and should by no means be considered an investment gnosis safe multisig address for contributions  0x32fd2b855a0e4b5ac7c9a15a4518c6db24e04fea  we would ideally prefer contributions in stablecoins usdtusdctusddai if you choose to donate eth the contribution would be considered at usdparity at the time of conversion the crowdfunding to fund  audit by  has just started  me and some early dao contributor has already put 5000 each into our multisig out of total 35000  we would really appreciate any contributions because as you remember we do not have a dev fund    imagine the tvl when we add more pools  what your power is good for when noone plays the game you have created  great founders understand the importance of giving up control to attract governors to the protocol  orwell is right but true defi is different than the meatspace as participants have options   take a look into sip3 channel on our discord    seems like transparency pays well and  with  lead the pack right now  it doesnt mean that they will necessarily win as in my experience a couple of whales can sway the voting minutes before the end  the question is do we really have whales that big  the voting on audit company for  has started  had a lot of fun working with  on that one  huge shout out to the companies on the list       put your swrv to work    haha true anyone who has tried to stasomething  a movement project company  realizes how hard it is to do that what the odds are and that it is not just 2 weeks of work lol  sushiswap and the vampiric attack on liquidity look pretty straightforward only in retrospection  sometimes i wish that  had some dev fund at the stato be dumped and heroically returned afterwards  what a marketing opportunity  why dont we just go back to boomer finance and find ourselves a real job thats up to the community but im pretty sure few people would object a grant we just need to set up our treasury first no premine no team tokens no bullshit remember when i was mining sushi my goto place was  by  the official site was to add and remove liq only  would love him to build a dashboard for  as well we have a lot of stats and events to track  instant bookmark when ready come on  list  already wed like to flex and show off a bit  swrv       for diamond hands only  got the same feeling when i tripled my first working capital never having to work again was walking around that day ready to wake up any minute this is too good to not to share  waifus licking bals  published and probably made by hash on  discord  somebody has just sent 1010808 usdt directly to swrv address now thats pain     well it is a feature compared to one account owns everything plus having influencers on the list further legitimize the project  fwiw i started following you because of political rants appreciate your pov on the stuff i usually filter out  but sir smacontract mumbojumbo is a way to make number go up  not arguing with your decision i would do the same in fact i did the same lol just pointing out that maybe the first time in modern history we got true laissezfaire  im okay with it as long as there is an open market where another whale can buy the tokens to counterweight the incumbents  for instanse if ethereans believe that what some whales do is detrimental to ethereum they are welcome to vote with their money  well the whales earned their power they havent bought tokens on a presale or received them as advisors  they mined and held them consuming the risks as everyone else  seems like fair governance to me   seeing enough commentary about bitcoin being a boring asset that it feels about ready to melt faces  ser wen binance muh familia starving ser  this is an old photo they are much skinnier now   getting  rekt  i like the word protocol  i used to work out with a guy who maid a highpitched aaaahhhh sound every time he jerked his biceps with 5 kg barbells i mean if it works it works lol  uma farmers get this  right after snx500      second that mike you are missing out on getting rekt by impermanent loss too   fair lets see how it goes    bal octopus is missing afraid of competition chef   what shitcoins were discussing inx  the glorious altcoin shilled by maxis themselves with rising nationalism amp socialism the only way to build an international tech company by 2030 may be to not build a tech c this game is going to be interesting   np were gonna release it like crv you can catch up later  honestly it would be cheaper to just kill it  if proper disclaimers have been made and the compensation for the risk is appropriate why not   we need vehicles for all types of people gamblers included  move on there is nothing to see here sir   i doubt even russians would take it  russian vaccine spoilt the party   i love both salty maxis and sound money sir what do  bal was listed on huobi yesterday  marketing and brand weight other than that yeah not much  send it to jk rowling to publish  hey we are making quite a lot of internal apps for our lab fintech mostly so no nothing public yet  given enough time and motivation i can make a point that bitcoin is shitcoin put a bit of weed in the mix and i prove that both udi and i are shitcoins i have absolutely no problem with discretionary monetary policy as long as people can freely choose betwee  yes i got it but what do i do if my visa expires before the travel ban lifted there are just 2 months left  thank you for the quick response my visa is issued after march 2020 and expires this october what do i do if there will not be any change in restrictions until my visa expires  is an im1 express entry  i have an immigration visa that expires on october 8 it has been issued on march 23 when am i allowed to enter the country  yfiii is extremely bullish for yfii  only maxis are salty bitcoiners increase their bitcoin bag in times like these      the pressure that guy handles is immense  john i have no idea what song you are talking about but here is another good one   can you elaborate on your views  i wish content like this were available in text great guest interesting topic but spending an hour listening to it is too much  sir maxis hate me now   not sure about americans but it makes a lot of sense to place china  being the middle kingdom 中国  in the middle of the maps sold inside the country  still too complex a 5 digital ocean node and some frontend will do the job    not having to

inconvenient i suggest them moving to china to fit the narrative  sir your healthy pragmatism has no place in modern society  nice roast you have to give it to him  stone age its super easy to become sceptical of remote work when youre listening to the current jerome powells news conference  the only clear audio is from the chair himself  that could be their scouts which tactics the vcs could be unaware of   i would make them aware  wheres asian sir once you truly grasp the language and its tooling public stock screeners become a thing of the past  the ways you can crunch and transform financial data are countless  what is even better is that the amount of your data sources rises significantly especially in crypto last 4 years i work with financial data a lot  and i have to say that python is truly amazing  everyone in both traditional finance and crypto should learn it  until it is not mainstream in a broad sense of the word it could be your alphagenerating advantage   no its just not us whos doing the pumping  those guys are slow but theyre getting there   the keyboard is lit   thats some good naming do not generate cash flow like bonds  ok bankers lets pretend negative

ago  everything about the city is just right top notch people amazing food unique vibe  for some reason most of my lifechanging connections i got there not in sv  i believe hes past anger its all acceptance at this point  my favorite type of drama is when geeks realize that other people dont care about tech  they care about perception politics and memes  unrealpolitik  last time during the shortage of dollars both gold and bitcoin nuked because people were selling them to gain much needed dollars  why do you think this time will be different  1 transportation tokyo moscow 2 food hong

data it is useless noise  moscow sir   deep research is not entertaining for most people we like it sweet and simple here sir     agree makes me poopish on ethereum   most governments lie to other countries and their citizens the us included anybody who says that there is no propaganda in the us is just an example of how effective it is   but if your definition of evil is the lack of free speech i agree china is much more evil   define evil    thats my favourite chanow the unicorn pooping rainbow makes me think of ethereum though    it works both ways just ask major tech and telecom companies  why you hate animals so much   true but both governments infiltrate their key companies and technologies alright   and they both suck royally in that regard  lol at the people who think that the us government more trustworthy and neutral than the chinese one   the correct answer is neither no country should possess that much hashpower  so jihans going to jail  it also means that when equities are well on their way to retest their lows bitcoin will become correlated to them again as people will be taking their bitcoin returns to buy some cheap stocks  shorts are so rekt  compliment the stache  everyone already is no way people do not notice how fast the dips are bought  pomp tweeted cnbc posted my normie friends panic sold  send it    unfortunately this is not how fund operate and its not that simple this is not retail  it shouldnt be per citizen  the whole fucking planet bears the consequences  the us government robs everyone and shares the plunder with its citizens  thats the scheme    no look at the gold and oil markets physical delivery is a small portion of overall volume   yup   rule breaker  well not exactly like weed  the power of meme isnt even remotely as

exhausted and miserable at the end of the day  you should already  mentioning xrp is a criminal offence this is where you call the cops  to be fair the fact that warren buffet could not find deals fit for his amount of capital does not mean that the average investor should not go fo it  that being said i am all cash at the moment  disregarded this tweet cuz no rainbows  why russian though  grandpa putin might not be the greatest fan of the us but communist cmon  solid exit strategy  will be making kids brb  carthago delenda est   thats exactly what makes twitter perfect for political

are littered with people on the sidelines not buying stocks  if we are going to fall it will be the most predicted crash of all times  well if everything went to shit once for a change that would be good progress  listening to feedback is a skill  too many people fail to appreciate the privileged peek into the mindset of the interviewee and try to correct their opinion or even worse take offence i find my opportunities where buffett isnt looking to big for mom and pop too small for the institutions a   i hope you didnt contributed to those scammers any meaningful sum and this lesson was cheap

fed indicator  the consensus seems to be that all these jobs will be back when the economy reopens  mhm  thats the opposite of what i see   most conversations here look quite political thus sophistical and more often than not toxic   twitter is twitter bitcoin or not  they focus your attention on content creation   there is no way you forget to scroll down to reach to your addiction that is the timeline  it is not a bug but a feature  that could be offset by capital flee to btc    another stablecoin but if i could have predicted its crash i would definitely bought bitcoin as there would be some spillover to it i could ride  without the people the intrinsic value of the network is zero though  people is all we have  what if they do nothing for a decade like nikkei   cz isnt as

wsb has it  zero suppofor sme and individuals in russia in fact they have introduced new taxes  someone also have paid for all of this so the dogs can have fun  im not sure what it means for the metaphor too   sir youre too generous it should be 6666  hb  heres your oil from russia      as i said regulation helps    thats what im saying  he didnt take this risk just because of email thats why it was easier to buy  you cant repurpose bitcoin for something else so you need to take on more risk thus less people will be willing to take it which leads us to different adoption curve    i doubt there were a lot of people buying pc just to try email either they used the pc for something else as well or they just used their institutions workstations  bitcoin requires you to assume some risk to try and use it there is no other way   yeah history bro    yes it might be like that  anyway my point was that bitcoin is going to have a unique adoption curve  thus analogues like email and ecommerce are however descriptive is not particularly accurate  they are good explanatory point though which is good   thats a very good point  however ecommerce gained adoption because it eventually became regulated which gave this industry credibility  regulation would defy the purpose of bitcoin though  sure but ask yourself how big is the risk appetite of a regular person in my experience not much  the average person prefers regular predictable life thats why people are fine with selling their time for salary  thats why bitcoins adoption curve will be very different  i doubt it is a good analogue as i wouldnt have to bear any risk to use email back then it was only upside although limited  using and owning bitcoin on the other hand exposes me to a lot of risk factors  theyre waiting for 3k every single time i see eric debating a bitcoiner it looks like a scientist debating a politician  common sense and logic against a narrative       right its me being toxic do you even read my replies      hate it pisses on blockchain innovation and new ideas in general are these your conslusions based on my disagreeing that reddit needs blockchain      why is it elegant to me it looks like a cumbersome piece of tech with regulatory risks reddit isnt a startup and its management arent geeks    unless there is some credible source can be traded freely is a speculation      even if there werent any regulations the whole idea of tradable points is wishful thinking  redditors dont give a flying f about trading they just want publish kittens collect their magic internet points and call it a day  it already works just fine reddit doesnt need   capitalism is a broad term i believe you meant laissezfaire    they said nothing about tradability indeed why would they the current point system works just fine    the owners of website can do whatever they want including abandoning the blockchain   unless you decentralize the website as well it is the decentralization theater    you still do reddit is a high load website ethereum alone wont cut it here   why crypto though as fas as i can tell they will be totally fine with a db  this reminds me of ussr as well being rich back then wasnt cool at all unless you are a prominent engineer celebrity or someone like that  and that is worrisome if money stops being the manifestation of contribution to society then the country is ripe for a revolution  yeah goa is different  a soundtrack from 80s is like mayo  i can consume anything with it  ccp  just wanted to drive your score system into negative  6666 is our true

street kid 1989 make money trading stocks learn finance lessons keep wife happy  the reason for this is simple emerging markets are less saturated and less competitive building a good app is often enough to get it noticed and used  the global scene is full of players and the most precious resource is not appstoolscontent it is eyeballs the people who have built successful apps in emerging markets often hit the wall when trying to ace the global scene  here is the solution forget about monetization and focus on building an audience  if you succeed in it even simple ads will do if not your app is dead i noticed that it is mostly introverts who believe that teleconferencing is going to replace inperson meetings  thats understandable  extraverts who tend to occupy more people jobs realize pretty well how little those meeting have to do with their purported agendas  his shohas been obliterated be easy on him havent look at it for 3 months and its still up and running  say what you what about the intrinsic value of bitcoin but the software is superb  impressive robustness   i m  the problem with all these blockchain projects is that there is the dedicated article about it and i still have no idea if they have built anything remotely useful  funding funding funding  fundamentally gigabearish  rekt   all of them are criminals can confirm moscows bubble tea scene is nonexistent bow to tapioca gods you infidels  is there a term for the person who want to see their own country burn to profit from it   the people whose hodl matters arent the people suffering from unemployment in the us rip ray      not saying that us colleges arent overpriced but the knowledge they provide is just one paof the package  the other two  networking opportunities and branding  are much harder to substitute because the former requires physical contact and the latter takes time to build  totally hope the hospitals are ready  perhaps their version is either outdated or not entirely correct anyway i would prioritise the mayors blog  my source doesnt mention your quote   moreover they promise to make their grip even stricter     lets see how bad it is lol so starting tomorrow moscow is in a fullfledged lockdown  we are not allowed to leave our premises except for basic stuff like groceries etc  as an introverted extravei have no idea how to feel  as a gym rat i miss deadlifts  i expect it to dominate all three of these charts at some point   they just miss other people  thats what arcgis says probably a glitch  if the issue persists you might want to clear your dns cache  was scaling the server up try again   yes  this charepresents the mortality rate which is based on the population number what youre thinking of is the fatality rate which takes into account the number of confirmed cases indeed  good to hear that  hope the govt will lock the country down soon  how is it u ok   im gonna make a white list instead it will be much shorter   its safe to say that they look like most russian corporate bonds  im on an unfollowing spree these two weeks sanity is leaving ct like the hash power is leaving bitcoin  twitter has empathy futures unlimited supply might not honor the collateral  why not both lol brrrrrrrrrrrrrr      sure but there will be less panic as most media are controlled by the govt and people tend to brush it off as yet another flu   im not sure we will see the little uptick before the collapse  the government is gradually taking down facilities gyms events and it seems like everything is moving towards lockdown no hurry no panic no hysteria  people talk about the cv all the time but tend to downplay its severity  this is moscow not sure about the provinces all gyms in moscow have been closed but bars are still open  barbells down shots up  got it  i miss the city  idk looks like a prison to me one amazing thing about the coronavirus is that it is really good training wheels for humanity  sometime in the future we will be grateful to mild toothless covid19 that has prepared us for some real nasty shit we will have to face  looks nice i miss asia though  feeling comfy in moscow  my personal hell is when the underslept me has to deal with shit the wellrested me has commited to   nice wallpaper  its still coupled though just didnt mimic the initial dip   print more money brrrrr   yes that was my point  dovey the second definition is technically correct humans do name things based on their geographical origin eg denisova hominins so no offence should be taken  the first definition is legitimately blockable offence as it incites racial hatred   gratitude is good but some of these sweet billions would be nice too  i like how qe coming with every block  looking pretty tits up to me  whatever price point will be after 3 consecutive days of receding confirmed cases in the us  no chance who has all of the toilet paper thats right  bro come to russia we have like 70 confirmed cases and its just a flu s  judging by my network i am an exdeveloper those people would annihilate all international relation and be thrown out of the government in an instant   sorry to say but stem people make shit politicians   marketers as well attention is money  insults are free engagement how to shill bitcoin responsibly  1 understand the investors time horizon 2 understand what they are trying to protect their portfolio against 3 understand their emotional profile 4 shill  many people got burned in this crash just because theyve been told lies by amateurs  their investment horizon and what they are trying to protect their portfolio against  that remark holds true for any asset including shitcoins  but my initial tweet has nothing to do with it what i meant is that before shilling a person an asset you should know their investment horizon thats all  gt 8000 is a decent price for btc on the longterm too  that is amazingly dangerous advice i understand your conviction and applaud it but you do not have the crystal ball  gt longterm gt fiat inflation  this should be emphasized a lot of people got burned just because some irresponsible mf sold them bitcoin as a hedge against crises  tremendous score  youre doing it wrong  ok can you guys stop selling i dunno man here in russia we have a bank that doesnt even have departments just an app and they mail you everything else   tp   never heard of this guy before but it seems like he is a huge liability to his country  i would do the same if i got tired of my wife  alcohol is the way to go indeed  chinese and russian moms are amazingly alike  got a call with exactly the same arguments  far from it  mathism  these mf keep printing toilet paper devaluing my stash  aurie you got it all wrong  the only thing that matters is flexibility and the lack of indoctrination  will you be one  include toilet paper then we will talk they are literally doing it wrong and as unbuffet as possible  if investors arent panicking why the f are they buying now   luck is a function with your choises being the argument  memeing    100k this evening no problem  since apple has replaced the whole top case of my macbook for free i can continue to serve my old master and buy those airpods as well i guess  fuck me  taking into account the number of independent parties cooperating to bring the whole system into action the stock market is also pretty much defi  who are those  and inflation  your screenshot gave me a coronavirus  brka literally cant go tits up sir  ah i see the bitcoin marketing department is at it again   extremely smapeople should understand the concept of risk management  if they dont i would doubt their smarts  ok can you guys stop bch  basically this poll shows the proportion of btceth maximalists in your followers someone on here once said public speaking is networking for introverts  id love to be serviced by robots everywhere no waiters no receptionists and no fucking salesmen  i like how after the first 5 presidents humanity forgot how to shoot color photos   well id like to see him lose to continue the circus ad absurdum ad infinitum  is it a michael burry reference the guy seems genuine to me not exactly an oracle but genuine  fair good point  then stocks bonds and real estate is cash as well according to your definition  the goal post is where its been so the answer is no i guess   what about stocks bonds etf i like blickfi but theyre tiny compared to the mainstream candy shop  bitcoin is an investment as well it will become cash when it is possible to buy investment products with it directly  all meaningful conversations migrated to private chat groups long ago twitter is a broadcastpropaganda device   carnage carnage needs to happen   oh stahp youre making me less angry at apple  let us know how you can be helpful afterwards  i already see such advice here and there specifically on reddit and russian investment communities   thats passive objective bro  twitter is an ultimate objection device  whats the app youre using  my frontbackend         my pm fit   so finance as usual  that doesnt look wright bro you should see a doctor  i would like to see you naked throbbing private key sir  i always found the patriarchal p in pets disgusting we should strive for greater inclusivity by adopting the term xets      thank you seems like its 120 blocks indeed     i got it what paexactly direct link to the piece of the souce code would be highly appreciated    care to elaborate one glimpse at how the average investor picks assets in robinhood is enough to stapreparing for another doomsday  passive investing is crisis fuel   must how is it enforced  keep us posted  literally cant go tits up  just promise me sweet juicy 100000 mega gainz and im in  oh and the deck must be decentralized and censorshipresistant but that goes without saying i guess  no ai machine learning and big data i think ill pass  trying to buy an ice cream for a penny   chard noun  a chafor some chad asset like btc or tsla  yup its exactly like this dont give up youre onto something  weve used almost the same pic lol    that wasnt her point  credit should be paid where its due  china is amazing at focusing resources when a problem needs to be solved  we can give them that  dovey i urge you to staa businessfinance news company focused on fighting the information asymmetry between china and the us  i follow you long enough to be sure you will be killing it in that industry   more like defining water as two parts hydrogen and one paoxygen  technically correct but useless if you didnt have experience with that substance  i am not in any way an ethereum guy but  defi is a set of open somewhat decentralized financial primitives   it is happening on ethereum but as a paradigm is independent of it   by the way anyone who says that defi is unnecessary has zero mainstream fintech experience people often overestimate the value of gettingin early and underestimate the value of conviction  getting early into bitcoin aapl or tsla without conviction might afford you a nice 50 bump but it is holding on to it what is really counts  what is really makes you a fortune  verified users    so true   yes but you can leverage your network here since we tend to surround ourself with likeminded people  textures need a revamp   sex tapes of politicians  care to elaborate on 3  character limit it should be increased  people need more space to elaborate on their opinions to reduce the overall hostility  unfortunately that will never happen as it would reduce the engagement  oh yes you can  defi is a paradigm which should be and is independent from ethereum the platform  i am interested in defi but i hold no eth  thats an amazing observation  wait are you telling me you dont even want to read like 30 hot takes about peter schiff forgetting his password what do you even do for fun islam is christianity with addons a viral mechanism and vendor lockin   there is the chinese new year selloff next week  udi youre brutal  we are fucked  islam is christianity with addons a viral mechanism and vendor lockin  media want to complain and attention  a recipe for success  pomp and say it bois     go to sleep  go for a walk  work out  talk to people  go for a road trip  personal tokens   my friend got iphone 11 three weeks ago and is ready to sell that crap already due to numerous reasons  as per mbp   apple just doesnt live up to its brand anymore  2008 apple was rock solid  sounds smart    tokenizing your time is good but a token here seems unnecessary after all i can use regular money to buy your time  now tokenizing your salary is something i would subscribe for  here is another one invest in things that can really capture value  yes that makes sense however bootstrapping liquidity and the network is an arduous task  it takes a powerful personal brand and perhaps refusal to accept regular money as payment  still why not to use just money in b after all i am not interested in being incentivized in another persons wellbeing ie taking on the counterparty risk  in b a token seems unnecessary why not just use money  i am not sure about d though how buying someones sentiment benefit me as a token holder  a piece of the salary seems like the best setup this way token holders are incentivized in the persons success which makes it a winwin  i just checked the bitcoin price and read your tweet i am on an unimaginable level of procrastination if you think bitcoin maxis are toxic try to tweet something negative about tesla  i like that reference  continuation of integration of bitcoin memes into mainstream narratives  now thats the rule i can happily follow  try hotels in hong kong theyre a steal now due to protests  the lego piece doesnt address that as well tbh  more accurate analogy    usually the difference is in the time horizon  speculation lt investment lt sov  redditors do it all the time at least in the subs related to fire  people tend to do it within their communities though today i learned that the chinese use red for profitable stocks and green for losing ones  just because the red color is associated with luck and prosperity  so this guy is actually pretty sad   thats the pawhere are would burst out laughing my ass off no way i can hear this manipulative bs and keep a calm face    what do you think about joining     thank you my vote goes to bitconnect for heheheeey and good memories  no idea what their logos look like and too lazy to google  click  satoshi is smarter than dudas   any plans for new collaterals  good point  right   at the high there were 01515 developers working on ethereum and recently its just 001612   makes sense if you are this or do that then you are antibitcoin  the people who say that are still not getting what this is all about  the only way to be probitcoin is to own it   that does not include listening to pontificating gatekeepers on twitter i see a lot of bitcoiners blocking each other since the launch of the nakamoto chat group   divide and conquer at its finest  executed perfectly  too much coffee bro  either you put your money where you mouth is or you are a fucking hypocrite and should gtfo  or just do not be a maxi focus on proper wealth management and keep an open mind  you would make a good therapist  thats what depression for a poor request looks like how much of your btceth would you sell to buy cheap stocks in case of a market crash  bitcoin is neither risk on nor risk off asset  at least there is no correlation to any of ron roff baskets  i think she as a base is even worse than he at least he has a profound track record and memetic baggage  would love to have a true neutral pronoun some people proposed e but i like the singular they better at the moment   well for some blockchains out there pos promising is the central point of sale indeed  waiting for the next halving    option 5 i feel a future meme  people need

would pay to get as a publication   on the brighter side these takes are going to haunt their creators till the end of their careers  just give it time  at least now i can see what i breathe    this thread is a good sta   im still shocked that you can pull off an ico like this in 2019 and get suppofrom several og bitcoiners   unfuckingbelievable  lawyers hate lawyers too   as my friend lawyer put

reading too much motivational quotes  if one is unable to work hard due to some reasons well  tough luck  life doesnt care  now what constitutes work and success is another story  looking forward to what you will come up with  may be this article of mine will be of any help with your search    i believe that demand is still here i see a lot of websitesapps that could benefit from readytouse social images  that can work too my initial thought on dbb was to make a lot of templates for specific use cases and see what sticks  i still see a lot of use cases for such an abstract tool  for one recently weve built  and it uses such images too  i think you will make it  unlike me  precisely because your product is much more specific than databonbon   i couldnt finish it and thoroughly explore the possibilities as i got sucked into the crypto rabbit hole tree years ago   qoutebooth was modestly profitable though  design automation was my passion for quite a long time too  i even had a soof protopreviewmojo project i believe    and here is another pet project of mine   sure lets have a beer when youre here im moskovski on telegram  oh im already back to chiang mai well be staying here for a month with a shotrip to phangan around 9th january  i like this narrative  technically buying bitcoin is converting your fiat to it  i think you meant mining  hit me up if youre up to a teabeer im here as well for today at least  looks like pai  bitcoin needs maximalists especially diehard ones   they provide and enforce easily digestible pieces of narrative for the masses the masses dont need sophisticated and nuanced opinions they want mottos   maximalists look weird only for experienced people  you are right but   here and there i meet people who heard about bitcoin but have a lot of misconception about it   educating those people should be our main goal right now it is easily one of the best bitcoin memes  1 rolls off the tongue 2 makes an accent on the divisibility of bitcoin 3 produced lots of spinoffs 4 euphemistic to hoarding 5 really popular   going down rn   another not financial advice for newcomers  1 buy btc stay away from altcoins 2 buy now do not try to catch the bottom 3 before buying learn how to store it safely 4 do not trade just hold it 5 go easy on bitcoin its still risky  cheers  i say lets put together a group of psychopaths instead zero sentiments ages of evolution cheaper than ai     sure will check them out but honestly i expect to see that they were dropping off due to limitation in their hardware or connection speed     yes thats exactly what i mean   potentially thats speculation id love to see the exact calculations   i synced an eth node not so long ago the bottleneck was the disk throughput so it seems feasible to calculate the increase in decenn if nvme would be mainstream     i will but im still unconvinced that its applicable for bitcoin although i might just  be ignorant on this subject     ah got it   so what will happen if the block size to become 15 mb 2 does it really make the amount of decentralization insufficient for all practical purposes     1 my initial tweet reread it please 2 i havent objected to that 3 kindly elaborate     you havent refuted my argument though what you did is resorted to an analogy it is an analogy and then to some unwritten rules of protocol building     i dont believe this analogy is apt     anyone opposing future block size increase should consider why we have small blocks now   larger blocks require better hardware and connection to process them decreasing decentralization   but as hardware and internet channels are improving someday we can afford bigger blocks  somebody should put a beat on it  but whore gonna promote them except us then  the best way to promote a book in china is to get it banned by ccp   the best way to promote a crypto product is to attack bitcoin  bitcoiners literally cant keep their mouth shut  we deliver attention to ethereum csw hearts and many others   you are all welcome     i think thats intentional and an amazing marketing decision most founders who failed at fundraising dont understand one simple thing  youre not creating a company youre creating an investment vehicle to bet on a specific outcome in your industry   thats what investors actually buy  not your code team or product  a betting tool  i feel like 2017 is back  ok hunter  ill be rereading the whole incerto series by taleb exactly what i need right now    so many russkih na kriptotwittere  feels cozy  took a noce road trip across thailand the last week in ct was a circus    it is mutable indeed but its mutability is a spectrum and bitcoin is closer to the immutable end of it at the moment    as one russian saying goes if my grandma had a dick she would be my grandpa    that would be a disaster but nothing happened    lets see     1 that was long ago as well 2 both guys are irrelevant to the network now unlike ef   definitely not lets give it at least another 4 years i mean the risk of an intervention isnt a dealbreak for me to learn and play with it   but it is for real users    thanks will try   i dont think so i can perfectly be able to hua network but not doing it because i have vested interest in it  economic incentives is a powerful protection as well   well i have an even better example  its a fact that satoshi asked to go easy with gpu mining when someone had come up with it   it happens long ago though   there is a spiked tenfeet wall with armed soldiers along it between had the power and did  well such a list demonstrating several unsuccessful attempts to intervene would be really helpful for converting skeptics     agree thats alarming indeed  thats interesting got a listarticle  please  lets not go down the number go up argument rabbit hole  the ethereum blockchain has been violated thats a fact that couldnt and shouldnt be ignored  ethereum has many virtues but immutability is not one of them happy to change my opinion when i get new facts  bitcoin hasnt been butchered the way ethereum has after the the dao hack so we have the guilty network and the trusteduntilguilty network  two points  1 if the gold market is dominated by bitcoin it will acquire new features creating other markets as it usually happens with dominant networks  2 until ethereum demonstrates the impossibility of another surgical intervention i consider it a research project  well it depends on how good bitcoin will be competing with real gold its too early to make conclusions so im happy to look at some actual data on it bitcoin lacks innovation is a misguided mantra   when you found your market fit you stop reinventing the product and focus on marketing instead   yes digital gold  stacking sats and number go up those are a memes   innovation is for newcomers  incumbents dominate   centralization which ethereum vividly demonstrated after the dao hack  i dont consider ethereum as a scam more like a research project and playground for geeks like myself  its not ready for the realworld usage and i doubt it ever will  but at least you can create a shitcoin backed by it eh         thats a valid opinion but what mark is basically saying is that bitcoin is still too much for his risk appetite yet   some people are choosing bitcoin over other assets          you dont even have to be censored all it takes to understand bitcoin is to experience firsthand the dire consequences of a failing monetary system     seems like ethereum has become a testnet for bitcoin  looking forward to it  you made a lot of assumptions on my pahere which i have no time to debate on this platform sorry  would love to have a chat over coffee when im in toronto this year though  1 thats compensated by the innate transparency cc have anyway we need some hard data here  2 those are shitcoins mostly and even the most gullible have learned to avoid them by now  3 agree   thats the joke also xyzninja is a meme in a dev community eg javascript ninja       does it get bigger with time brokechain noun  a blockchain that is unable to secure itself  ungodly ungold  russia is a realworld crypto space   the perceived possibility of yet another surgical intervention  no i didnt say stocks are far more risky i said the safety of stocks is illusion  1 huge information assymetry 2 stocks  us stocks only so much bigger counterparty risk 3 too easy to buy without basic research  i still stand behind my analogy to alcohol vs eg lsd  thats where we agree stocks afford you lots of verified information   so given that you properly reflect on possible manipulations and huge information assymentry between you and insiders stocks are safer for you indeed  not so much for a regular retail investor though  i do not live in the country i pay taxes to where can i get a refund    nah  a major issue dossa pointed out was block reorgs which are technically possible in pow systems  however ethereum has only experienced one reorg ever following the infamous dao hack of 2016     there are two things applicable to stocks but not to cc perceived safety and big names including the govt backing them  i trust govts no more than i trust wall street  i get your point its valid but unless were insiders we grossly underestimate the risk of holding stocks  stocks growth are fueled by inflation which coupled with the convenience of buying it and really prominent brands and institutions behind them makes stocks really nasty substance for retail investors  the bull market temporarily alleviates the issue but the black swan is ahead   can someone add me there too cant wait to exploit this amazing marketing channel  im pretty sure  can provide valuable input here as well  young ninjas cant stand experienced samurai  their integrity  what are your sources   gt these are the people on the other side of your trade  i mean why not information asymmetry should be monetized 10 years ago i was working 12 hour days running a single business   10 years later my business partner chris and i live  statists  as i said it many times marketing is everything your product might be crazy good but if your user acquisition strategy is facebook ads youre toast      лол thai baht symbol  is used as the sign of bitcoin  1 baht consists of 100 satangs  so both bats and bitcoins are made of sats   mind blown   i realize that just pointing out that your criticism is misplaced and unprovoked   dude youre wasting your energy on the wrong person just take a look at my tweets   reserve currency my ass  but muh inflation sir   9 powerful and recognizable brand  10 robust and stable base layer software   here take a look    originally from russia but last 10 years im moving all the time  i dont know but  is on it  give it time bro keynesians if people believed that money will be going up in price they would stop spending  me buying beer with bitcoin   in the parallel universe   i love the phrasing of your tweet games are everything  on the contrary  every single time   as much as i want it i doubt it but the community gives some hope indeed  after all bitcoin being in the crossfire for many years and hasnt budging an inch is worth a lot  yet its in infancy compared to usd and the puberty is right ahead nice fallacy   it works because few people can adequately calculate and compare the probability of a catastrop  nice fallacy   it works because few people can adequately calculate and compare the probability of a catastrophic crash in btc and usd   however the lindy effect tells us that btc is much more prone to losing 99 of its value   ah ok then   i think im going to run another test of new geth on the cheapest hetzner server with nvme that should be interesting  no it is harder and require more resources to sync and maintain  also geth is less stable than bitcoin core i havent tested parity though but  have  absolutely 12 cold storage devices enter 6 devices leave     instantbull   because usd is a tool for exporting us balance deficit to other countries thought the means of inflation   that became possible due to historical reasons like us defaulting on its commitment to redeem usd in gold  reserve currency should be decentralized   that doesnt mean usd is good it means everything else is even worse   imagine living in a country where your best bet is freefloating debased inflatedoutofproportions usd   what a hot mess  i love how fed can be universally hated across the globe  by every citizen of every country they have robbed through inflation  what if god is the master node of all blockchains and fiat currencies and this guy knows how to connect to it  mindblown friendly reminder that you should not trust the volume on cmc either   im ready to move to the us buy some guns and lose it as well   bitcoinish on the world   being offended is a social currency yo  very true still has a room to grow to withstand a statelevel attack bitcoin should have been created in africa   usable from day one  much needed from day one  battletested from day one back in town just got approved to chiang mai bitcoin group and am already happy with what i see  kudos  for being head of cm shitcoin police lol   true but id have to deal with the limitations of visa and the bank in that case    after going through hundreds of 20172018 ico whitepapers i literally cant read shit off of his shitcoins website its all blurred   shitcoin blindness is a thing   i believe it really boils down to what you are trying to achieve with meditation modern day living is very different from what we have evolved for so sometimes being natural is detrimental to your goals id say day dreaming is great for ideation but terrible for execution every time i cross the border of a country i cant help but think that if i tragically hadnt lost all my bitcoins in a boat accident it would be a really convenient way to transfer wealth without the obligation to declare it   i dont think its attainable for most people but we should try to catch those moments and get back to the mindful state asap just like you try to return your mind to the object of your meditation if youve noticed that youve been distracted the more attempts the easier it is   i havent read his second book as i felt that the first one was enough to stapracticing i encountered a couple of setbacks here and there but overall its been smooth progress so far  you do not turn off anything  the crucial thing is to be mindful of what is occurring not to control what is occurring  henepola gunaratana mindfulness in plain english       you should join our club    lol im in   i think im entitled for some royalty bro hey  just wanted to tell you that your ads in podcasts work and im finally checking out   awesome episode with  by the way    bitcoin was created centralized to be decentralized   esperanto was created to be centralized forever its a feature    agreed but the decentralization of the governance over a system is a spectrum and up to debate  this is where esperanto being centralized by design stops being metaphorical to bitcoin  id say the main reason esperanto failed was lack of valuable content languages are tools to consume and broadcast data thus no data no stimulus to learn the tool  well esperanto might be lifeless when it comes to poetry or memes but these are not the only functions of a language it still could dominate science and business  but it didnt  id argue that although technocrats might not understand how those systems work moneywise but people like  or  definitely do  thats the beauty of distributed systems they unite experts  good one  also esperanto sucks in poetry and memes which means less marketing opportunities what would be your best comeback on the following statement  bitcoin is the esperanto of money superior to its competitors but is still struggling due to the network effect  my usual comeback is check yours   complaining about other peoples privileges is a privilege and it should be checked   thanks  more research on his pai guess somehow he came to do not trust verify naturally  analytics mostly so its been almost half a year since i set up a bitcoin node  just a regular 20 droplet  40 volume from digitalocean  zero glitches 100 uptime used daily  robust as hell  hardships are blessings in disguise my 65 yo dad got bitcoins value prop in an instant  partly because of his tech background  partly because of living in russia through the 19982008 crises and watching his savings turn into paper  he doesnt trust bitcoin but he sure as hell trust tech more than the govt i refuse to take the convenient path of throwing virgil under the bus because i firmly believe that that would be wron  true i hope its just a stepping stone    nice but it doesnt look like it has efs support  there is no spoon one mans divisiveness is another mans decentralization   ethereum is losing the marketing battle ef should organize some marketing body to direct efforts   the bitcoin community is superb saleswise  but muh sanctions  also  being angry at someone teaching prk how to bypass sanctions with ethereum means you actually believe that it could be done which makes ethereum fully censorshipresistant   boom  ct lets subvenation state through crypto also ct muh countrys sanctions  thats the weedest tweet ive seen today  altered  programming languages are interchangeable because the end user  your products user  couldnt care less what lang the dev of their software has used   it keeps everyone away tbh  well thats how twitter works everyone has an opportunity to show in which area they suck royally   not to sound too toxic but according to the pic any one of those reasons is enough to slaughter ethereum  in that world the biggest pursuit of the humanity would be finding a loophole that allows you to retain some of your previous memory   enough to lets say memorize your private key  as much as i like chris peacemaking effoits not gonna happen tribalism isnt going anywhere   in the centralized realm we could have hoped for a leading individual or organization to unite us all but were in the decentraland   our best bet is moderated tribalism        peter trolling people and being trolled in return is my favourite genre on ct   telegram is russian as much as google is russian having a russian speaking founder doesnt make a project russian  settings gt  notes gt  new notes stawith gt body   you know the rules you should threaten to make fun of someone first   past performance isnt indicative yada yada yada  all your examples can easily translate to fuck me in quite a few cases   keys can be lost or stolen  not much to buy with it anyway  volatility or the minsky moment can easily eradicate your wealth without any inflation  ah come on lets just throw shit at each other  whats your shources  another reason is that tech people suck in understanding social stuff royally  coming from a techie    why not both  good old strawman attack  unbanking the unbanked ah a library  what a perfect chance to get away from annoying cybertruck fanboys and read an oldfashioned physical newspaper     theyre definitely profitable for them one thing i like about the crypto community is its sheer optimism  theres like a century remaining till the last bitcoin mined tech disruptions happen left and right but were already debating if the network will be able to sustain itself on fees alone  what a tribe im surprised that people still fall for that even after the ico boom   nah im pretty sure the cool petal on hong kongs flag gives them longevity my little brother picked finance and crypto as his industry of choice and asked me for a book to stawell that wasnt too hard  work is amazing  i hope next time he will reread it in english though    i said nothing about failing ethereum and specifically defi  reread my tweet please  yes it did and ethereum has failed as the world computer ico platform and probably a dozen of other narratives which hadnt make it mainstream   innovative products fail and pivot often thats okay  sats are good for marketing though   and speaking of marketing its right about time to show the satusd price in all wallets exchanges and analytics  a couple of years of such coverage and sats will seem as natural and easy to rate as btc  bitcoin you mean that shit people use to by drugs with  thats normal people  they still have no idea about ethereum or god forbid dai   its all our cozy little bubble folks  tracking large transactions and major events at                    no                no            im afraid bitcoin doesnt fix this   fucking pineapple qe  its only oligarchic if you prohibit everyone else to acquire and own it  yet exchanges and p2p are free for all and will always be in some form  can i be a keyboarder now thanks  not sure what bothers me more this operator salad or that i can actually read it to understand why we need sound sov go live in a country with a corrupt government  to get why defi is crucial try to work with traditional finance entities  bitcoin has flaws as sov ethereum has flaws as a defi platform  but both are the best we have now and much needed  any involvement from a government is a risk if the government is huge the risk is huge as well every time i try to pay for something with a credit card in shanghai they give me such a look as if i robbed a museum and try to pay with seashells libraries gt bars   i mean guys were already discussing and tweet about him thats how we got csw in the first place   phase based decentralized development implies a greater risk of malevolent intervention bringing down the whole system thus if youre decentralizing not fast enough than more chances that all development efforts will amount to nothing  satoshis disappearance is bad for the speed of development but good for the actual decentralization  i would even go as far as to say that seeing him neutralized dead or in jail would be an even better outcome for the network  i wish him long life and luck though  in this case blockchain has no relation to bitcoin whatsoever       torrent traffic is falling because companies have came up with better solution for content distribution so to apply this pattern to btc central banks have to do the same and innovate   their inability to do that is precisely what gives bitcoin strength   all points youve listed also apply to china except freedom of speech of course so yes they are comparable   is it much different than any other country  bsv cloud storage looks promising actually   thats innovation  they dont outside of our cozy crypto bubble people love the usability and customer service banks provide they couldnt care less about decentralization and censorshipresistance  thanks thats exactly what id like to read today   gt if you dont have the asset you should not be able to pretend to sell it  why   right which means that its the most effective want to outsmaone of the worlds most prophetic investors easy  just hold your bitcoin till it hits 50k  patience patience patience   a utility token yes  but the demand though   stop giving frauds attention please  yeah its bitstamp look like the majority of the transfer is the change though    amazing article just one nitpick  the stock wouldnt go to 420 any rational investor would price in the probability of elons profile being hacked  so the price surge would be much how much is another question smaller than expected    sorry eric but its not an option its an obligatory currency and the penalty of not using it is ultimate    yes a crash where to  heavy breathing the people telling count me in when its mainstream now is exactly the type of people complaining about fierce competition in their industry of choice later  risk is yummy you should develop a taste for it lol  i share my numbers with the closest friends and partners thats a bonding thing nan  i bet there will be a whole different set of countries at the top  small nimble troubled players can easily dominate this industry due to stronger incentives to adopt bitcoin  right thats the type of apps im talking about    because the value proposition of bitcoin isnt the speed of dev like youre not gonna get better coke if pepsico would shift its marketing expenses to their rampd  jedem das seine  you mean promoted tweets yes ive been seeing them for quite a while gross indeed   does any one of them have an access to what eric and i mentioned  also what all these people fail to understand is that despite facebook having terrible reputation amongst nerds and activists it is still a powerful household name showing no sings of dying   standing behind libra   looks quite soviet the good thing is that even on such a scaled down droplet 4 cpu8 gb geth is syncing as fast slow as on a much bigger one the bottleneck is the sdd indeed  inb4 endless sync its syncing pretty fast so i will be able to catch up within a day or two well its not over yet approximately 3 days ago geth seemingly crashed and now im behind 3 days worth of blocks again  what sucks is that i havent enabled logging so i have no idea what actually happened  will keep an eye on it     folks ive got to go thanks for the discussion see you around     because most people wont try and understand the real dynamics of power within the community they need a face to trust thats how it always worked  and yes i want the person with the deepest knowledge working on the project  again good for the project bad for decon     it is a good thing for decentralization not so much for the actual work     i do as well as media and outsiders unfortunately thats how the world works people always look for a face to pin to the entity and now that face is vitalik     bitcoin doesnt have the founder around  again im not suggesting that theres some other way all i ask is to accept the fact that vitaliks influence is stil big     to an extent yes but not as much as if satoshi were still around     oh but it is even a prominent bitcoin dev isnt the founder of bitcoin and having that status does give you some edge  but we digress lets talk ethereum     thats not how it works its not enough to change a line of code you have to persuade the community to use the app as well     i didnt say that its wrong or theres another way but we need to own the fact that the figure of the founder is still big in the eyes of the media and most people outside of the community  its something to work with not shut it out     well its your word against mine than  we need some hard data to settle this     correct the degree of mutability is what truly matters though     research is exactly what influences the project and the community  over the years ive seen a lot of efforts to disentangle vitalik from from the perceived leader role and i commend the community on it but its still not enough to claim it to be leaderless we need more time     i think thats a rhetorical question implying that vitalik isnt perceived as the leader with immense clout and influence in the community     i agree with that my objection was about scarcity alone  however comparing ether to gold isnt correct gold doesnt have a leader directly influencing its price so ether is okay as a shortterm sov but to expand the span it has to be leaderless and more predictable     my initial argument wasnt that ether cant be used as moe uoa and shortterm sov  it was about scarcity  is usd scarce for those at the bottom of the pecking order probably for the establishment doubt it     do you even bitcoin bro    meaningful scarcity measured by inability to print more units diluting everyones else holdings  that is meaningful scarcity future demand is irrelevant if theres a possibility of infinite supply    i used ether as money but whats uncapped cannot be scarce lets cap it first then talk scarcity also i wondered how long itll take form someone to try and do something nasty with with the node since the ip is known from the screenshots and the rpc is open as well  well not so long  this industry is really stimulating       ive scaled the droplet down to 4cpu8gb 40 and altogether with 600gb volume 60 the total cost is 100 pretty steep for a voluntary endeavour but palatable for a commercial app and yes  was right it took exactly 4 days so when im in stockholm im buying us a round     so its over  i should use  over  as they have ssdnvme  last several days took enormous amount of time to sync  tomorrow ill try to scale the droplet down lets see how my node will be handling the load  shosummary 20 days 8555244 blocks 426g size    id really like to have shots called sats on the menu so i could be stackingit    will try thanks    oh yeah youre right does the chronological mode respects the show less often option    i dont know for done reason the network thinks it can decide what is important to me so i routinely miss some important tweets  itd be better if we just stopped give him attention of any kind    that wont make twitter show every tweet of my whitelisted accs just impede less desirable ones  congratulations fam  i hope someone from do will send me a sexy pic of one of their servers because my node has ridden it to death i swear     well when its implemented i might consider redoing the whole thing to try out syncing with nvme as well and its gonna be much cheaper since ill be using one of 40 hetzner servers      18  i think  was right and finishing off these two last month of the history will take longer than 3 days  also the size of the blockchain makes me a bit frustrated well  has warned me about this so im prepared  b 8218326 20190725 r 166g s 389g    also nice source of drama ie free marketing     were only getting started the whole project is one big marketing strategy lol     lets see i hope its less than 3 days though its the last piece we need to launch our app     16  3 months of the history remain cpu are still doing almost nothing  everything is stable and boring i guess nothing can compliment geth better   i expect it to be done within 3 days  b 7923018 20190609 r 15g s 355g    sudo resize2fs devsda     14   be building a real world app and open about your goals  use real world infrastructure  deliver real world results  get

ethereum for me for today   stackingsals    sure but unless the server has an ssd nvme every stop has a substantial cost  it scares the shit out of me but it seems like im gonna need the access to debugtracetransaction which presumably requires a full archival node to detect failed token transfers i hope im mistaken though   god bless our souls  thanks that helped literally one command     12

20180721 yay ram 173g size 169g  bullshit i can outhumble you with my humblissimo    yes thats my observation too unfortunately do doesnt offer nvme ssd a popular thread on rbuttcoin about my thread on twitter also i love redditors i really do so hilarious       what does make you think it isnt a full node   try adding deadlifts as well otherwise very toxic and maximalist instant like  day 6  dear diary syncing a full  node is the most boring task ever nothing happens geth is just doing its job as it should i pray zeus amun and  egregore to send some minor glitch my way just to feel needed again amen  block 5762638 ram 175 gb size 143 gb   lol yeah i hope things will speed up a bit when im in the bear market  also initially i thought that cpu wouldnt be having so easy time   day 5  geth is ultra stable no weird freezes no sudden gobbling up of memory  tried to test the already synced paby randomly querying rpc blocks and analyzing their transactions works like a charm  current block 5531529 20180430 ram usage 16 gb ssd usage 118 gb    that will be enough for now its nonarchive node but yeah im going to need to scale it up soon as the blockchain grows pretty fast   thanks  i believe its intel xeon cpu e52650l v3  180ghz and ssd wo nvme ie standard do droplet and volume  thanks looks like geth is more efficient than parity or my do setup is more performant than top macbook cc  the latter is less likely lol  anyway were chugging along im thinking about scaling the droplet down right now this node syncing business wasnt so scary yet esd geth edition  day 4  im surprized at the days results were at the block 5227729 already which was rather intense period 20180310 but ram usage is still the modest 16 gb  blockchain size 92 gb   moscow and easily chiang mai notably every single one of my closest friends has left our home town so its not even in the top ten anymore ethereum syncing diary geth edition  day 3  things have slowed down considerably as were syncing jan 2018  memory footprint is surprisingly small at 165 gb why did i bought that expensive droplet again cpu are working hard though  were at block 4909789  8444643 58  ethereum syncing diary geth edition  day 2  weve zoomed through ethereum early days and is slowly making our way towards the 20172018 bull market  synced more than 51 4346912 blocks oct2017 out of 8434573   the server feels just fine with geth taking up 15 gb ram      yeah that can solve it thanks geth has spread itself across all available cpu quite nicely memory usage is hovering around 33 gb  the blockchain has eaten up a little more than 1 gb of the ssd at the moment  syncing early ethereum history makes me a bit nostalgic  this is to be a full nonarchive node which means its going to be executing all transactions of every block starting from the genesis  when it finishes syncing i believe we will be done within 3 weeks im going to scale the droplet down a bit to make it less expensive ethereum syncing diary geth edition  day 1   today im going to try and sync a full ethereum node like  did but using geth instead of parity  the playground is an 8 cpu  32 gb do droplet 160mo  500 gb volume 50mo  so lets geth syncmodefull cache28672      not sure what to do its a rollthedice every time we create a droplet our russian users arent happy either every third ip address that  assigns to my droplets is blocked by  in russia  im not sure if this is the toll the  witch hunt has levied on the country or someone is being unprofessional here but its frustrating   second that  us raises tariffs on bitcoin  bitcoin goes up us raises bitcoin on bitcoin  bitcoin goes up us bitcoins bitcoin on bitcoin  bitcoin goes up  bitcoin bitcoins bitcoin on bitcoin  bitcoin goes up me and crypto trading   i wonder how many of those requests are served by    until they do im not buying their sudden makeover  i believe 3 addresses your point somewhat my point is as long as something has some legitimate usage and an active vocal and respected community anyone can safely use it without fear of being associated with the bad guys  1 bitcoin can be and is actively being traced its not monero after all 2 cash still reigns supreme as a means of illicit payments 3 bitcoin has an active and passionate community of supporters which makes smearing the cc not easier than smearing free speech  the world is full of people who want to control other peoples anything modern life can be complicated and confusing sometimes i wake up and dont know if i identify as a tech bro or as an ammosexual    im fine with everything else just dont claim that money isnt in the equation business is always about money by definition   exactly this is the very definition of business  if someone enters the game with the itisaboutexperience mindset they are greatly increasing their chances to get stuck in the never ending loop of sexy little projects that very few people actually use much less pay for  gt starting a business is not about money its about experience  wut  the best pain the bitcoin game is that the only direction the supply can take is down   all calamities  deaths the loss of keys mistakes  are beneficial for the holders visiting my friend and just look what ive found   the bible of my childhood  bitcoin blockchain indexing is mesmerizing  running stream of hashes looks like flames or whatever you want actually  perfect rorschach test lol    is it that almost anyone but white euros is lacking some important skills or there is something more sinister at work like systemic racism  this two bills arent entirely fungible either some people prefer the old one because its classic with enormous brand power    definitely a thug  also goncharov translates as potter which resembles putin  gotcha unfortunately it does all it takes is to dig up some transactions related to drugs pedo and terrorism after that its their usual playbook   im interested in buying your twitter handle please contact me via dm or alex if youd like to sell it thank you  caas content as a service   also they are cheap running a full bitcoin node costs me 50  crypto twitter is american intelligentia   instagram and facebook are still useful in developing countries for instance there are a flamboyant instagram blogger community and a sophisticated facebook audience in russia  however globally these two networks are garbage  twitter and telegram ftw   it looks so good im afraid of even installing it  oh crap  i wish there also were a free diablo ii clone if so rip my productivity voting using electricity before it was bitcoin cool     now that would give the nerds a fighting chance  its neglected despite being profitable my other much more promising projects take too much time at the moment   not gonna happen unless tech bros is going to figure out how to get their sweet share of monopoly on violence the way east india company did   absolutely too many people conflate being rejected by  vc with being unworthy   being rejected by vc means youre not suitable for their model thats all no hard feelings the project might still be awesome   love the 力 chars power force chinese on his pecs    second that plus meaningful work is a stimulant by itself  im always surprised when i hear from fellow nomads that bitcoin doesnt work  like you can transfer lots of wealth between countries get cash from localbitcoins and live happily thereafter with zero involvement from governments  but yes cant buy a coffee with it sad  1 marking some accs as important making 100 of their content appear even on the algo timeline 2 muting some topics not keywords 3 twitter groups  wow i thought such laws are in place long time ago hope the koreans will depotheir lazy sorry asses back to their homelands  its freezing here in moscow readyforglobalwarming   decentralites bonus points if youre into crypto  nomad dating would develop the whole market nicely the way i see it     hope so    any insights  one of the best thing i love in life is that when this legal and ux nonsense get too intense then despite all moral arguments despite all potential legal problems people still manage to find their way out  piracy  we may despise it but it serves as a much needed stimulus  buying btc dollarcost averaging forgetting about it for several years this is the soundest strategy for most people   stackingsats     cc   productivity software marketing tools etc while a lot of people high on unicorn success stories engage in risky startup businesses its much more profitable to just build boring small products in competitive but evergreen industries   this is the business opportunity of the decade  work hard go slow keep real   this technique in also useful to prop up the share price if the holding company has already ipoed  sometimes public companies even buy other products just to send a signal to pump up their share price   next rounds of investors buy out the previous ones and at the end this snowball of expectations falls on retail investors spiced up by more expectations of course like this    yep exactly this is what vc backed companies do they burn money to pump up public metrics so they can attract more investment  their shareholders dont profit on well profits they profit on exits   it might be that i just got old and become uglier but i wouldnt underestimate the power of cash in keeping the company afloat and the numbers sexy   again i didnt say they succeed because of cash  they succeeded because the app worked it was amazing and i as then a single person benefitted immensely  but it looks like those times are long gone this is my experience as their 4year customer   being a paof match guarantees a huge pile of available cash ready to be deployed to any product that needs to have nice public numbers at the expense of others see okcupid  i dont argue that tinder didnt work see my initial tweet i say its stopped working   few people want to use was addressed to a cesspool not the app  as per usability no i dont have any data besides my own experience and the experience of many other  users across internet  but tinder is a paof match group of course they have excellent numbers   not saying that telegram is going to take down tinder but the latter is doing this job quite successfully itself  its somewhat usable in thirdworld countries but in the first world its become a cesspool of complacency vain and narcissism very few people want to use  thanks will take a look at it  more or less yes id prefer this tool to deploy to my server though do linode or aws guys is there something like laravel forge for nodejs a tool to provision servers deploy a node app from git and do other stuff like control workers edit options etc a lesser known fact about bill gates is that he owns some of his success to his mom  mary gates was the first woman to chair united ways  committee alongside ibms ceo  this is where his decisive deal with ibm came from  behind every great man is a great woman indeed   i seems like theyre rolling it out for russian users first  fun fact in vietnam ecuador and brazil there are bigger proportion of women than men involved in startups total early stage entrepreneurial activity  qatar is truly equal in that regard  lebanon estonia and egypt lead in male domination  when i dated on tinder  ive met my wife there  if a woman had telegram that was a huge green flag for me  now heads up telegram is implementing geo chats that means you can talk to people around you so its like prefiltered tinder  dating opportunity of the year  quora has anonymous answers and theyre orders of magnitude more interesting than public ones  lol  gotta catch em all  got more of them    it doesnt matter at the end of the day unfortunately potential businesses see unrest in media and just leave they may sympathize people of hong kong but theyre businessmen not political activists and they will act accordingly to their economic interests   exactly thats why hong kong is in such a terrible position now it fights back it loses its stability it doesnt china slowly gnaws its freedoms one piece at a time screw conspiracies but it almost feels like the whole situation is carefully engineered by someone   yes protests make the city less attractive to businesses which seek stability i sympathize protesters but my next company will be incorporated elsewhere  hong kong is on its back for a long time already as much as love the city nowhere else my heaskips a beat when i leave the airpoits attractiveness to businesses has been destroyed by the very people that fight for its freedom not judging thats how the cards are dealt   lets suppose youre a female ios developer with 5k followers on instagram devs mostly a rudimentary ios dev course and a desire to make it a fulltime living business what nontrivial things would you do next  a real person is behind this question there is a misconception that saas is a new paradigm  centralized hosting of business applications started in 60s back then ibm and other providers did utility computing business offering computing power and db storage to banks and other firms from their global data centers    so true our reactlaravel stack produces this kind of pain everyday  general and administrative expenses basically everything else that isnt included in other categories cost structure of a typical software business in 1984  while some activities have become obsolete since then like manufacturing please note how minuscule the cost of dev is compared to everything else  and still some indie devs today focus all their attention on building   great perspective and it will be this way until the next cataclysm spawning its multitude of competing nodes eventually to be consolidated to several giants ready to be disrupted again beautiful   you can scratch america and usa your tweet is valid for any country and any large group of people for that matter our only hope is that tech will help to curb this circus a bit some founders throw in the white flag when they see their competitors got vc funded  well it actually gives you an edge go freemium go long and watch your rivals collapse from the pressure from their investors  it really boils down to how bad you want to have your product 50 years ago in 1969 ibm unbundled the software pafrom its hardware the revolutionary system360   this act made it feasible to develop thirdparty software which sparkled the extensive development and proliferation of the software industry as we know it  techhistory   congrats as per auditing hold a private walkthrough webinar with reputable and preferrable popular people from the industry theyll verify and provide an additional coverage as a bonus although i wonder whod doubt your numbers giving your level of transparency  yeah old medium will be missed building companies is complicated  likewise my brain refuses to interpret greek words as anything but formulae  wow they took uselessness of apple touch bar to a whole new level    maybe pivot to other countries like im pretty sure japanese sweets is trending in moscow and perhaps in thailand apple bugfixesandperformanceimprovements app   updates has become a free attention source for marketers   true i should have used better wording   i see your point but youre conflating the terms poor and privileged you can have all the things those founders have and still be poor but theyre privileged no doubt fantastic thread  yes airbnb founders are privileged but the mob attacking paul is missing the message if you are underprivileged well tough luck youre not gonna build a unicorn however you can build a 1000 10000 or 100k startup after that go bigger champ    i wonder how big of an impact nl has on cangu theoretically such focused attention should build up the community there like crazy  sure but migration will take a lot of efforts and time i use mac for like 10 years so at the end of the day its my problem   absolutely  i hope so   id argue that it will be the generation after the next one the threat is real but the ship is too big to turn instantly  because if they lose the developers to microsoft it will be the beginning of their downfall microsoft understands that and strikes just in time while apple is focused on ios im pretty sure apple is aware of that breach in their defence and will react accordingly i think indie makers are all too much focused on shiny b2c products when the real money is in b2b  thatll sound weird but id stafrom the history of marketing to gain basic understanding and current pain points then just google everything you dont understand then try to promote something easy  whats your industry and what tech you currently know its getting easier and easier to build apps   its getting harder and harder to get attention   if youre a developer you should invest in learning marketing that intersection is and will continue to be extremely powerful now thats how you do popups  this thing popped up at the bottom left corner   haha thats a nice coincidence i received calls from authorities on a monthly basis saying that they totally understand that thats not me but can i please help them find who has placed that ad about hash cocaine and whatever ive just realized that my idea sourcing framework has grown to be like 20 approaches long and is still growing i dont think that jamming it into an article is even remotely feasible seems like an ebook is the way to go  listen to 1 people like you and 2 two steps ahead of you theyre advice would be by and large relevant  agree the advice is sound indeed  my wife did this only to go back to a developer role people are complicated code is simple said she  10 years working remotely half a year managing a remote team of 90 people at peak  maybe    paddle for international projects yandexkassa for domestic apps both gateways output revenue to a russian company however i think ill have to incorporate elsewhere soon hong kong or singapore presumably  i used some gateway cant remember which one to accept sms payments they solved the conversion issue and seized like 30 of revenue as a commission i was such a noob   id rather listen to a 60 kg guy who become 80 kg guy without anabolics than to a genetic miracle pumped with some extra testo i love arnie but i wasnt born like him and will never be like him his tools and experience are useless to me entrepreneurs trying to build their first business but reading buffett or gates resemble budding athletes trying to gain muscle by following advice of schwarzenegger or björnsson  both underestimate the importance of luck both is going to get extremely disappointed and crushed it was a classified for my native town  i monetized it through google adsense 200mo and even implemented some paid features like putting your item on the main page 100mo  had to put it down though due to constant requests from drug monitoring authorities   yeah corporate employees make shit startup employees  theyre so accustomed to playing politics instead of doing the actual work they bring this habit to a startup and wont stop until nothings left of the morale  the only exceptions are the ones who are sick of this bs themselves   looool  thats tough but its how we roll i guess  entrepreneurship is essentially a probability game you should be willing to sacrifice the stability of positive outcome for increased upside   that means youre gonna screw up 9 times but will hit a jackpot once  i like this article but strongly disagree with that pathis is exactly what you should be doing you should stretch your boundaries you should be evolving if it makes economic sense  business is about evolution and adaptation  people often confuse introversion and social anxiety  one of the best salesman ive known hates crowds he has no idea how to influence people en masse but this guy is a god in oneonone settings he can crawl under your skin through your hearight to your wallet   haha hope so  in my 10 year nomad career ive burnt out twice all i wanted was to crawl into some apt and never leave  longer stay affords a lot of opportunities friends deeper understanding of the place its more cheap   definitely my choice nowadays or im just getting old lol so according to twitter analytics yall are really into dogs which makes sense actually we may argue whether jquery is still relevant what use as a backend framework and if its feasible to employ react hooks  but you just cant hate dogs  flowers of those plants are competing for bees attention   their roots are trying to outdo each other in procuring water and minerals  the leaves are growing as wide as they can get to grab more of sunlight   competition is beautiful   that would be pretty broad id go for content suggestion and meme prediction service its industryspecific but doable smb owners usually have needed manpower they just need a little professional hint on what to do lets give twitter analytics a test  you prefer  that and social media services being an inherently hard sell  content suggesting service would have a great fit with some content generation features maybe  however there is some caveat here one should know how to sell such apps as smm tools are notoriously hard to sell any time i ask smb owners about why their social media accounts are in a such shabby state i get the same answer  we dont know what to publish and cant afford to hire a social media marketer  if this is not an opportunity for a saas i dont know what is im old enough to remember bill gates being an ultimate villain now im their well not exactly a fan but definitely a happy user satya nadella does wonders   kudos to steve ballmer for laying the groundwork and appointing him   if were talking sex with many women count me in looking for a way to increase your productivity besides mandatory  sleepdietexercises  ive got you covered   ps sorry ladies men only the first rule of pornhub is we do not talk about pornhub  why dont we still have below average looking people rights activists its a political gem  1 there are a lot of them 2 theyre totally underpriviledged 3 all genders colors and religions can relate  whod like to take a stab at founding such a party if the internet turned the world into publishers crypto will turn the world into investors itll take a while but small ca  thats what ive accepted too for most of my projects it can easily be that i just suck at performance marketing but it seems like the only one who always wins is the casino itself um i mean the ad platform  besides i have zero problems with russian in that regard giving the genderbased nature of its words the language has many issues but its surprisingly fine in that regard  right thats close to impossible in russian but i meant english in the original tweet a nice and succinct summary of why capitalism must go    its very convenient indeed in russian not so much im afraid onona for heshe eeego for hisher  its as confusing as in english actually  every time i encounter heshehimher in a text i stop reading and try to reread the paragraph to understand why the author decided to stress the gender  nine times out of ten its irrelevant  why cant we all just agree to use the singular they all the time no no no this cant be true the oldest industry generates tons of money you dont say  being the first is important but having a better product matters much more  compare those two submissions to product hunt great email copy was the first good email copy had a great product  do you ever wonder what if jon snow used front gameofthrones got winterishere jonsnow frontapp  having an audience means you will monetize it one way or the other having a product means nothing  marketing trumps making  this and i also want apple watch pn steroids  larger more features and a huge pile of apps i really dont like to carry my phone around all the time the more i learn about software the more i realize how futile the attempts to make something useful without understanding human psyche are  so the lone geek trying to build their next unicorn should stay where they belong in the dream world  idk got it from google images til you can use aboutcrash in chrome to simulate a network crash for testing purposes   super usable  spreadsheets rule the world  if youre looking for a new tested idea look no further than spreadsheet templates people use  take into account the shortcomings of spreadsheets and solve them in your new app  you can stawith some public templates     in a shoterm yes but on a long enough timeline  unless the cheater isnt orders of magnitude smarter than everyone else  black swans are gonna kill them     kickbacks schemes and other financial shenanigans can easily amount to 10x of the founders legal upside  regulation helps but it lags behind the creativity of some people  its not always vc vs founders btw ive seen some cases of vc  founders vs lp thats fucked up  among other things yes it still can provide valuable input while ideating in a nutshell   yeah id like it too    everybody is after these juicy sweet views and were gonna drink this vinegar till the end of social networking on importance of timing luck and perseverance  this is the same product unsuccessfully launched on hn several times within a 9 month period  today it hit the spot  a simple rule for making a good header on your apps landing page   emotional appeal  how youre going to help  there is more than one way to make a good header but i like this one best  being a nontechnical founder is a bliss they are protected from making something people dont want naturally   if you can code thats great if you cant its time to double down on building an audience   its the burglars  banks vs countries  terrorists analogy theres no need to disprove every element in conjoined statements to highlight a false analogy  its a counterintuitive statement indeed to disprove it you should attack the reasoning i provided its the only way   1 burglars and terrorists have different motivations  one of them seeks publicity another one tries to avoid it at all costs 2 styles of attacks are also vastly different burglars actually has to get out alive  so no apples to oranges this that said strive to find someone like you and who youd like to become it will cancel out some biases   i go out on a limb and say that perhaps the places which are considered the safest are actually the least so terrorism feeds on fear and attacking the safest place yields the maximum fear and corresponding it publicity this is exactly what terrorists want power through fear i highly recommend using a trustium model for testing your ideas it has 3 tenets  1 a user pay after the service is provided 2 they pay if and only if they are satisfied with the outcome 3 they must provide feedback  when an idea is good almost all of them pay  georgia is awesome in many regards as per canadian pr i guess it boils down to a personal credentials indian telecom operator reliance jio has crossed the 300 million customers mark in twoandahalf years  quora grew into india organically  english proficiency among indians is extraordinary  many ceo of top tech companies are indians  forget china the future is \\\\xa0indian remember how i said that getting money from your customers is nothing compared to looking at what theyre building with your product  well scratch that all of that is orders of magnitude inferior to seeing how theyre actually getting leads and clients through your product one of my recent hobbies is going through my followers tweets manually what interests people who are interested in my content have quite a high probability to interest me as well   the amount of ideas and potential niches ive discovered that way is beyond counting  try it if youre thinking about emigration take a look at canada easy to get pr fast citizenship awesome people proximity to us taxations by residency unlike us strong passpoill be moving there within a year been practicing for their climate most of my life charts charts are everywhere  i think i need to take a break from crypto  trolls and salty people on social media should be celebrated not shunned if youre a marketer the reason is simple they give free engagement  do not consume negativity conveit     absolutely love the pace of development and what php is transforming into  totally agree i use the same strategy across all networks including quora somehow facebook managed to escape this strategy until now  the way i see it conferences works for  heavy sales when theres a need to discuss a product in person with the speaker  pr purposes like been a speaker at x conference  immigration purposes again they specifically ask about articles and conferences  freaking extraverts the problem with makers is they focus on shiny dev ideas to stroke their shipping ego and dont have a strategy i subscribed to a bunch of nichespecific groups on facebook and the social network has started actually bringing value to me which it never did for a whole period of its usage  thats a weird feeling     sure its just a hyperbole proper prior planning prevents piss poor performance    on numerous occasions i had to check if a var is set and i didnt care if its null but thats besides the point naming of an entity should reflect what the entity does you might want to look to the most popular user note in the official docs     heres more     exactly or just make isset do what its supposed to do without any side effects and accompanying them hours of debugging   absolutely   the naming of builtin functions is a disaster just google it just one example the isset function which supposed to test if a var is set but actually tests if its set and not null  love the language but its inconsistency is killing me just bookmark this piece and look at it anytime you feel like youre fighting goliath your leverage agains vcfunded competitors  zero investors breathing down your neck  you can grow at your own pace good for the culture  no big budgets less politics in your team  zero bureaucracy faster decisions  can choose to curb profits  maximize happiness anytime  1 worse quality of components overall 2 i like when everything is javascript 3 react seems more mature  we started as vuelara btw decided to switch at some point never looked back i know its a russianism but i just love to use the word landing as a noun meaning a landing page  anyone else  doing everything solo is much faster at the beginning but after a certain threshold it becomes a chore which should be either a automated or b delegated  i starts everything by myself but when it becomes obvious that an idea is sound i gradually shed responsibilities to over people then i starts something new again by myself so its been 4 months of using react instead of jquery takeaways 1 managing ever increasing complexity has become orders of magnitude easier 2 i love doing frontend now 3 were shipping much faster with react 4 laravel  react  lt3 5 feels like my team can build anything  capitality  reddit has a lot of lessons it could teach other networks twitter should take the downvoting mechanism medium would be much better off with their comment structure 9gag could use some spelling upgrade facebook nah just kill it  sure im happy to share but its still too early its just several paying customers lots of created landings and crazy amount of work ahead i think im onto sonething actually considering a little pivot  just ask them on quora anonymously if needed although youll get slightly biased answers its helpful  twitter is good for playing politics not learning about it too much noise   no heartless autofills warm and nice submissions only  bitter salty offended actually  anything of that sofits twitter pretty well ok the most embarrassing product launch thread  your turn   ps you cant nominate your own projects  this is an image from whole world catalog a publication mentioned by steve jobs in his famous stanford speech   it always reminds me that being ceo means being chief energy officer  you are responsible for your teams morale   you are the source     should you charge more  yes   now get back to work     one of the greatest sausage parties on the planet second only to wall street    and after a month there i discovered beautiful weather overprices reality estate passiveaggressiveness lots of homeless people and freaks shit you are right   first impression ive got about san francisco was a mixture of smells of piss weed and unwashed bodies yup i walked out of the subway at the market street   it turned out alright after i lived there for a month  sex is boring ive read about it  also building for yourself has these benefits free of charge  you have perfect understanding of how to market this product  you have your first audience your inner circle  adding more features is so much fun  they range from social media apps to traffic exchanges now dead allocating time slots in a calendar app and sticking to them religiously  treating every domain of activity as meetings dont be late give the subject 100 of attention have a definite agenda and outcome  anything else doesnt work for me   allocating time slots in a calendar app in sticking to them religiously  treating every domain of my activity as meetings dont be late give the subject 100 if attention have a definite agenda and outcome  anything else doesnt work for me a friendly reminder to all developers building their project   staselling now   businesses are not built by building you have to talk to people you have to put yourself out there  they wont come when you finish your product  perhaps thats the way to attain enlightenment    i should probably admit that theres some exceptions like popups that shows when a user intends to leave the website if they are nonblocking its perfectly fine from a users point of view   it definitely is everything that irritates a user and can be quantified by a search engine is a negative ranking factor and i firmly believe that here were talking about not a couple of ux snobs like me popups are more or less universally hated  sure   5month clients are absolutely the best easy to sell to large in number fast decision makers and hold you to the highest of standards  nobody has influenced my growth as a business manager more than 5month clients   one more supporting evidence even the conversion powerhouse like  stopped using any forms of popups at least i saw socialproof ones around 3 years ago for the last time and all you can find on it is this modest form built in the flow of the page    it was just a simple blue material ui sticky header with a larger green sign up button nothing fancy  as far as i can remember the conv rate drop compared to a popup was like 810 but the final revenue was still the same  the app in question was a small menu builder for vk   anything that doesnt brutally interrupt ux in mobilefirst apps i usually go with a cta button fixed in a sticky header in desktop ones it depends on the layout   let me also clarify its not a moral high ground i believe more elegant ways of capturing leads actually give more profit precisely because thay are a unobtrusive b more modern and not burnt by constant use   mostly i agree with you but id like to challenge the subscribers  money pathe quality of subscribers vary considerably especially of those that were dragged into the subscription by such a rough method as a popup we should optimize for the bottomline   awesome chayes popups can give such effect but it really boils down to the ultimate desired outcome of a campaign im convinced that the quality of leads may vary considerably also see my latest tweet re 5month clients the reasoning is pretty much the same 5month clients are absolutely the worst they create the majority of suppotickets have the unbelievably high rate of failed  and fraudulent  payments and are the least friendly people  if it isnt true for your niche congratulations you own an empathetic unicorn  popups is a digital analogue of the old car salesman meme work only for the audience that was hiding under the rock for the last 8 years or so and hasnt been bombarded with popups from every corner  i believe people has a kneejerk reaction towards them and close popups before they even fully render this is a very old tactic and people have developed a blindness for it especially if a popup distract from the content they initially came for top 5 marketing tactics that doesnt work  1 camelcase in titles 2 pitch paragraphs in texts 3 subscription popups that block ui 4 social proof popups 5 almost any popups actually  trying to gain extra 35 of conversion you risk losing much more do not be irritating  now that beast is on completely different level til there is a programming language which unlike any other language ignores regular characters and interpret whitespace chars only  its called whitespace and heres what a hello world code spaces and tabs are highlighted looks like    that proves that violence exists in thailand which i agree with my initial point was that the thais are superior in terms of nonagressiveness though not that they dont have violence  oh crap you reminded me how we shipped a fucking landing page for two months in a mediumsized corp i was ceo of all thanks to the pr and legal deps what a joke nice feature though   great app   yeah i mean its an opportunity for someone   philippe with all due respect i dont need any statistics i have more than 6 years of interaction with thai people and about 8 years of nomadic lifestyle to compare they are that friendly exceptions apply though as always average producthunt product of the day 500 votes gt dead in half a year   gt 180 votes gt 8000000 of investment gt alive and kicking for 8  years  just a friendly reminder that your first launch doesnt mean much  id even go as far as to tell that the thais are superior to everyone else in terms of consistent politeness and nonaggressiveness   well you will have much more islam is highly polarized i used to work in the halal industry and got death threats on a monthly basis was totally worth it though i met a lot of awesome muslims as well now its time to give credit where its due   doing russian taxes is a piece of cake because of several amazing banking and accounting apps available for a very reasonable price   doing my yearly taxes takes about 5 minutes     the armchair is awesome  outrage is profitable and media did their homework russian media is more or less the same btw different set of holy cows though  security guards are my favourite good relationship with realworld moderators can be super helpful sometimes   the daily grind there offers best burgers in town the more i learn the current marketing landscape the more i like holy shit it is as  unnecessarily complex as the dev ecosystem  a great deal of businesses doesnt need to know even a third of it  which of course what is it all about an opportunity  came here to recommend estalila but found that youve already booked this great choice you wont b disappointed i spent a month there and it was awesome   awesome i also like yahoo lodge in tokyo which is free and offers an amazing view chrome gt dev tools gt network gt speed throttling gt 3g if id been developing chrome id put this feature right next to the switch window size button  this morning ive generated a brilliant marketing idea while sniffing on this bad boy this cant be a coincidence they surely put something in it   no its more or less dead already cant tell for sure as i stepped down as the ceo in may i wonder if  penalizes submissions that got upvoted by an army of bots because my todays submission definitely has never seen that before  some entrepreneurs think that getting paid for your work is the ultimate joy thats not completely true  the ultimate joy is watching how your users build something with the tool you have created  nothing beats that  ps looks cute   its interesting how get rich coaches are mostly successful though you cant cheat life or love but you can scam other people out of their money guys i finally have finished my new app and just launched it in product hunt  take a look at it i desperately need your opinion on how to improve it and what should i prioritise  so enmarta a simple landing page builder for instagram and much more   zooms numbers are insane  why  very huge market  sell to all sizes of companies solo consultant to f500  freemium model unpopular opinion  edition  bring it on  its also good to remember that almost every dependency is an opportunity for your next project  1 you are aware of its shortcomings and know where to strike 2 you are your first customer 3 cutting a dependency can be a reason on its own  but downloading packages feels soooo good  me highintensity treadmill exercises deadlifts squats all soof presses killing a dragon conquering the world  my apple watch oh i see you have lifted your ass from the couch should i record this as an exercise  no missing features just lots of bugs  both from the user and dev point of view  browser monopoly is a huge problem indeed but taking into account how crappy apple has become softwarewise i wouldnt trust it to counterbalance chrome ical is buggy itunes is abomination etc ios safari is the new ie6 it should be killed and replaced with the chrome engine as soon as possible neon noir by tony skeor  cyberpunk neonnoir digitala according to these gentlemen exporting html to some countries russia bad hackers sanctions vodka bears putin we get that is subject to us expolaws  what a time to be alive   yes that might be the case as well empirically i find it hard to believe it though it seems to me they just dont have the data on whether i did the purchase or not  however the more i live the more i realize how unpredictably sales stats can be so you easily can be right unpopular opinion   i bought a display facebook shows me more display ads   bought a keyboard  more keyboards   why not upsell me something  frankly i dont care when they sell my data to third parties but they can do better at mining it so ads become more relevant ill be staying in moscow for a while so its time to have some luxury of permanent work space too bad good i might be back in hong kong within three months haha ratemysetup     perhaps i should do such cleansing too at some point    i follow a simple algo 1 try to unsubscribe in one click 2 if unsuccessful mark as spam you got a marketing email from a company you remember subscribing to but are not interested in receiving such emails from your actions this church in barcelona is a good example of a seller who has zero idea of what they actually sell  a big paof any mass religion is a great deal of ancient touch and old aesthetics  electric candlesticks my ass  warning this site uses cookies and other terrifying technology like java script because its not 1996 anymore but you probably a  angry are they 6 see the small red circle in the middle  its a ferris wheel in hong kong its only purpose is to give you a nice view   any skyscraper here does the job much better just collaterally  if one day you feel like your job is pointless just remember the ferris wheel in hong kong  someone made how many customers to earn    bill gates on the mouse when we first brought this out we ordered 50000 and it took over a year to sell the first 50000 to  real entrepreneur todai i learned that you can buy a bag of shredded us currency it made from used and torn down dollar bills by bureau of engraving and printing the very department that prints them   wanna some bbq that smells like

character the first paof the citys name 香港 hong kong cantonese  my shampoo is trying a little too hard to be liked by everybody   bought it because of cruelty free i like the idea that the molecules were happy and unharmed while the chemists were synthesizing the product  one of the biggest mistake budding entrepreneurs usually make is avoiding competition  competition is great it shows that theres money here it shows what works and decreases the risk which as a beginner you tend to underestimate  follow the competition then lead it me and react actually  fan hos rare colour photographs of hong kong in the 1950s and 60s    thinking about reading it too  it surely will the book is brilliant  omg in a huge hn thread about book that changed your life the top one is master and margarita  i wouldnt say that it changed my life but i read it like 8 times and its only getting better  props to bulgakov for exporting something not ruining russias reputation globally  if you wonder how far small incremental updates with good enough patches and occasional refactorings can get you look no further than your own body  messy inside but still good and reliable enough to use to get to my apartment in kuala lumpur i have to tap my card thrice and pass two security guards  bitcoin is less secure than this fucking building now after my new project has grown a bit in terms of complexity i understand why exactly react and the likes are so big deal im a huge fan of the contemporary chinese ui school not to diss quora but i find zhihu a bit cleaner     im pretty sure that facebook employees can find another job quite easily no starving and being homeless in their case they just dont care enough    exchanging your values for money quite easy actually  i think it heavily depends on where you live go for the city center and some highrise and youre gonna be alright  its the most desirable outcome indeed however a somewhat pinkish ocean is good enough for many  omg super cool i might be heavily biased nostalgic and just old as hell but i find windows 95 theme and interfaces amazing   here have some retro porn  your app when your developer takes frameworks a little too seriously   totally i love how green the city is  actually i consider moving here too its an amazingly wellbalanced city it seems like ive even got accustomed to the weather  ummm just no kuala lumpur is one of the most underappreciated cities in asia from the western point of view     cheap  close to singapore  decent amount of vc  english speaking  ethnically diverse  love it  computers  design  apple b2b  open servers  salesforce shops  internet  amazon  great business ideas are always about the intersections of two or more industries   find the ones youre an expein   i mean i understand why they dont do it artificially stifling the stream of inbound leads is not a right thing to do for a business but yes its much needed   thanks that could work every time you think that youre not gonna release your app without some really important feature remember that twitter still doesnt have the edit tweet button  then ship is there a feature on  to ban posting my project  lets suppose i want to do it myself later and have a full control on the narrative and the exact time of publication  itd be nice if i have an opportunity to add an url after verification to a donotpost list  indeed actually theres even more  im rather conservative so i tend to omit ultra new tech ive just learned that jss automatically inserts css vendor prefixes when it is needed  so you just write userselect none and it becomes webkituserselect none when the user has say safari  what a time to be alive  this morning my girlfriend found an error in my js code which could easily waste a couple of hours of my time  takeaways 1 date developers 2 have morning conversations 3 save time by spending time  however it really hinges on your definition of the undercaliber person  i did no they arent useless as you can learn from their brilliant knowledge of their audience and the campaigns they do all the time  surely your understanding of intricacies depends on your level but definitely not useless its so easy to tell an entrepreneur from a lay person   the latter looks at kim kardashian and justin bieber and sees stars   the former sees marketing grand masters i think this box exposes some endpoints not sure though  personally i prefer the bootstrap game the reason is simple im good at discovering ideas building products and selling them but i suck at complex human interactions i enjoy gathering people around some common cause but thats it when politics kicks in i lose interest  yeah maybe material ui is pretty bloated bootstrap youre good at building products and selling it you accept that you will be playing a long game without fast and fat upside in return you dont need to manage anyones perceptions of you sans your teammates so no financial games just business vs youre good at people interactions you realize  and let everyone know  that your project is risky but has potentially huge upside you accept that managing people expectations  be it vcs your teammates or ipo investors  will be an important paof your job some entrepreneurs see the vsvsbootstrap thing as a the ultimate evilvsgood fight it isnt those are just different types of a game  both can be played ethically and unethically testing react design frameworks  material design can be pretty neat this is the material ui framework by the way  sign up form still quite raw from my next project  better last then never  i just discovered a fantastic consoletable in js which neatly print out its argument as a table  given massive success consolelog has with the majority of js developers thats a major improvement in usability    visual studio code is the best thing happened to me this year its addons marketplace doesnt stop to amaze  below is a fantastic plugin showing the colors in your stylesheets be it css or jss  dear    this bug seems to survive me you and the whole humankind  when i check do not as me again i really mean it this piece of software has become senile got alzheimer and keeps showing me this dialog every time it starts  please consider euthanizing it   couldnt agree more one of my recent favourites is visual studio code satya does wonders to microsoft  oh i member   yeah thats one piece of abomination  just by looking on its name i feel blessed having not used it  good one i hope it dies out within a decade tops  my alpha versions beat itunes hands down as well lol ok heres a challenge name one piece of software that is like absolutely worst in the world like you want to find the managers who made the developers write that crap and fire them worst  ill go with itunes this restaurant is just asking for a competitor named plan a to give them marketing hell   plan a the only plan you need   haha so true  oh yes that bugs me at parties too   totally that would be much better setup  the rare opportunity to practice handwriting haha not sure about the rest of the world but here in asia often you can make an order in a cafe in a written form    less useless interactions with people   lesser probability of a mistake   tangible proof of what you actually wanted   feels like programming  yay   i didnt say im against it  which use case its become increasingly popular to just slap cookie warning on every website which uses them this is incorrect  where cookie consent is mandatory analytics tracking where it isnt keeping a user logged in  do not contribute to the madness please  not easily but doable tbh i have never seen a filthy rich digital nomad what never stops to amaze me is discussions among digital nomads on whether bitcoin has any real world use case  besides you being able to transfer any amount of wealth through any border get off the grid and live off the cash localbitcoins provides you  not much i guess     thats right you just deny them entry with a huge red nochargebackabusers notice then you get a backlash then you take the whole story to media thats how awareness is raised and broken systems are replaced     thanks guys one more request though i really want to give all the website automatic consent for using cookies so they dont bug me with those annoying popup requests an option do whatever you want with cookies somewhere in prefs would be handy thai toilet door tables  female version breasts in the shape of w and legs in the shape of แ แมณง mother  male version shoulders in the shape of m and legs that look like ผ in ผชาย man  somebody has put a lot of thought into those logos love them   its in dev yet will release soon eventually ive decided to go with react instead of vue in my new project when im wearing my business hat i neither use complex solutions  that means no angular nor do i invest in underdogs  that means no vue  not trying to staa holy war just a boring guys preference this is twitter in a nutshell cleversounding but mistaken diss gets thousands of likes but with zero effect lambda school wi modern social networks content is dead personality is king  i believe that every developer should at least once try a managerial role the lack of empathy and the ability to communicate can be daunting when dealing with hardcore geeks  as a developer i get it humans are complicated as a manager i refuse to treat children like adults  yeah that sucks some people say that 2019 will be the year of niche nice social networks i just hope someone makes a nonpoliticized clone of twitter so we all can leave all those angry people behind to wallow in their misery as well as angermongering media  onwards  this month ive been testing the twitter ads subscription 99month they automatically promote your tweets heres the final stats i wouldnt say ive gained much the extra reach was irrelevant mostly   looks cool and solid indeed thanks   seems alright now  was thinking of that too thanks  i might be mistaken but buefy doesnt have some essential components like sidebars sliders steps etc it also seems like it lack the wrappers for some parts like menu of its underlying framework bulma  thanks for the link js people what ui component library would you recommend to use with vue taking into account that i dislike material design buefy looks nice but is rather incomplete ant design vue seems solid and sleek though something else  fair points i like arrows just am a bit frustrated it has introduced enough new complexity to warrant a quite long explanation on how  to use it properly  oh sorry about that twitter ads does this automatically and i have no control over it  here  do you like material design verbosity is bliss and by the way how is the latter easier to read than the former  i might get roasted for this but most improvement in js seem like unnecessary syntactic sugar polluting bloated out of proportions js universe  you know youre screwed up when you have to use a flowchato explain the pitfall of an operator designed to make your life easier  can confirm that most of my best decisions in life came to me as black swans now i might be biased here as im oblivious of what opportunity cost i have paid to get them still its a blissful ignorance  exactly theres a huge difference between building a mass media website where theres nothing to steal in case of a breach and an app which has to hold lots of critical data  it helps to be an expein the latter case and using the tools built by experts  whats even better you can easily transfer the code base to another maintainer since everything is stardardized some habits of indie makers doom them to stay indie makers forever seen a lot of php with jquery vs php framework with js framework arguments among indie makers last year it seems like people genuinely dont understand that by investing some amount of time into learning new tech you make your code base easier to maintain not harder weird  haha indeed now this is a product that gonna generate some sustainable revenue unsexy check solves a distinctive pain point check very specific full of marketing opportunities easy to pack for media check check check  nice job  my favorite thing in life is to postpone adopting new tech like you switch from jquery to vue and freak out how amazing it has become like you upgrade your iphone and marvel for a week hows your mug is your new password love it me no complex stack your dev env sucks vanilla ftw also me wow i wish i learned this lib earlier  _ツ_ it seems ive completely missed it but the goals feature of  is really helpful  to be perfect it should also include a word count target and a huge nice progress bar to engage the writer  so its been a month since i replaced my old iphone 6s with iphone xs and i must admit apple still is capable of designing great devices   faceid rocks new gestures made me forget the home button at once and the bigger screen doesnt hueither  highly recommended     the icons themselves look pretty weird also by the way have you noticed how ridiculous the term digital nomad is i mean i aint traveling in no cyberspace its the good ol reality and im still the same carbon based meat bag just sayin  i took this shot on a return flight to hong kong the other day sublime and minimalistic just the way we love it  if i were to pick a single element of an mvp with the worst costvalue ratio itd certainly be the logo you can spend a huge amount of time designing it only to find out that nobody cares  idea matters product matters logo doesnt pick a font type the name and youre good   nah man the best forum for a maker is the one where the customers for their projects are stopped following all these maker communities long ago too much mental masturbation still read some of makers though just because of their internet personas  12 where brand marketing does matter especially outside of consumer recruiting a great team raising money partnerships that being said you absolutely can and probably should sporadically use your social media clout to sell something just dont make it your primary objective invest in your social media presence cherish your community and followers because every one of them is your brands free ambassador and collectively they help increase that network effect we all strive for on the bright side having a strong brand helps you not only to sell more but also  attract better talent  manage crises more easily  make your company more valuable  make your and your partners personal brands stronger social media game targets your brand and helps you sale more its an inherently long game and thats why so few smb have guts patience and resources to play it well demanding sales from your social media accounts is like imposing sales targets on your pr manager its not going to work because thats not how it supposed to work by the way heres a great article on how amazon products should actually be named   any time you got stuck with naming your project just remember that unpronounceable hard to decipher and memorize amazon aws ec2 s3 rds vpc route53 ses sqs waf are gobbling up the market at the moment  then go with this mahbestappie you already have a domain name for so more humanity less business bullshit folks as marketers scorch the media landscape this rule becomes even more true 3 more often than not store owners severely underestimate the intellectual abilities of their prospects according to the feedback their visitors left on review services putting big brand logos fomo notifications and fake reviews on your store isnt exactly the brightest idea 2 almost a third have no idea how the addons they put on their store affect the conversion some of them according to the feedback end up paying for some visual marketing gimmicks for months because theyre too afraid to put them down 1 most low budget stores lack any content marketing strategy whatsoever no blog dead social media accounts zero humanity which is ironic as the only edge they have over their bigger competitors is being as noncorporate and friendly as possible as a paof research for my new project this week i have sifted through more than 500 online stores on shopify and magento i also followed their feedback on various addons heres what amazed me most according to evernotes main page what theyre selling is a feeling of being organized not an actual state of that  thats counterintuitive for a productivity app after all we want to be organized not just feel it but feelings are easier to sell than the real thing  humans   admittedly it depends on the industry but large deals are made in person not over email to some saas companies the location  as well as their network  is everything an example  email marketing software gt mailchimp etc gt bloggers gt convertkit  those specific business saas are much harder to disrupt than their more general and bigger competitors so pick a business industry you always wanted to dive in collect its biggest scariest players analyze their major client cohorts you can differentiate them based on   price and size  location and language  industry  and other characteristics  then just build a killer  a tip for finding an idea for your next project  unlike marketplaces saas b2b software are vulnerable for disruption by niche players since a b2b saas usually have a very little if any network effect and those big players cant afford to focus on some particular audience  thanks man it wont be long before i get back i promise  both has their own merits tokenized fiat makes sense only if its underlying asset is properly managed citizens of shitholes are still better off with bitcoin at least as a means to transfer capital  one of the reasons i love san francisco some people think its the most walkable of the major us cities  got it where are you going to be in earlymid october  i have to spend like a month in moscow and am going to tokyo for a month or two then through hong kong perhaps will be happy to meet lets stay in touch  i have just returned from chiang mai it is almost touristfree and yes quite a few new businesses have sprung up here and there since the last time i have been there eight month ago  indeed lean is most certainly not dead  the building software is hard narrative is a paof the competitive weaponry of established players   do not fall for it     thats the point people responsible for that are incentivized to do the ranking right as per content  well most news are bullshit anyways some buffer company news to share weve spent 33 million buying out our main vc investors  this is something ive be  investing in current icos without some insider information or some measure of control is financial suicide utility function of some tokens might be useful though  true as of today  however your argument does hold in certain niches primarily in those whose inhabitants can appreciate the beauty of engineering per se or are politically motivated  use our  killer dapp and you will be paying 25 less users couldnt care less about the tech powering the app however they do care about the benefits it gives them market phenotype not genotype  definitely white but the overall attitude depends on the state ny and ca have too much smarussians to be bigoted about their accent or origin although less diverse places might have some prejudices i havent experienced anything more than standard vodkaputincold memes im actually pretty excited about rather than scared by the growing liquidity of usdt its the first glimpse of why tokeniza i just love to watch old videos about business and finances they always have the distinct vaporwave flavour in them  that being said most utility token buyers are truly amazed when they learn that the token they have invested in is designed to be sold not to actually capture the value and appreciate in price what a bummer there are a lot of criticism on the unsustainability of tokenomics just because it puts an extra hurdle to using a product  however if you think about it every single saas has the same obstacle its called a paywall  both are a means to capture value and work just fine 1  for a demo yesterday i tokenized a security using the bitcoin blockchain on live video  it took 10 minutes using a we  sounds fun  im already here  while this video is focused on apple it can be applied to almost any tech business the aof being a great ceo hinges on the ability to balance two things marketing your product as a masterpiece and making sure it really is  if you want to understand the nature of hypes better take a closer look at old tech news this will give you an idea on how media induced hypes work what was

fight but isnt it wiser to keep sharpen one weapon instead of build walls against every attaker restricting access to known pleasures means youre helpless against yet unknown ones and are doomed to fall prey for them every single time im not saying that you shouldnt strive for a better environment however plunging your ass in a comfy chair doesnt grow you any muscles blocking is a losers way and

article since my last article ive got tons of messages only 1 are somewhat worthwhile  totally agree its also best to combine both approaches as  do  no research just thousands of users of my projects most of them want predictability even at the expense of the payasyouuse approach there are some exceptions of course ads granular orders but as a general rule avoid uncertainty in pricing at all costs pricing tip make your pricing so that your users can predict their monthly spendings monthly packages are good billing per item isnt  sure theyre devsprod persons after all however the results are not that bad the vast majority understand how hard sales now is guys i need your honest opinion as a developerproduct person i feel sales people are  remove the dot off of the i make it a fucking stripe that might seem obvious but i see this fallacy perpetuated too many times   it heavily depends on the niche youre trying to enter as a general rule the more specific the better  thanks for reading

a lil break  its from google docs i believe its fine  its a commercial product so i dont think it makes sense to do that as for snippets yes perhaps ill add it thanks  well its pretty big to be included in the article  not yet but i definitely will just need to accumulate stats a bit its one of the most interesting subjects perhaps  theyre just a complementary services designed to draw attention to the main product sometimes theyre not even usable just viral and fun i just published how i built a profitable saas web app from idea to first sales   will def read it thanks  not yet but

is really good  sure was thinking about buying a couple of it too  it was targeted to companies there were a lot of numbers that have to relevance to me as a customer whatsoever thats weird i mean im no sale grandmaster but as far as i know deals on selling airplanes should be done a little bit differently have been served an ad on youtube about new boing 737 are they trying to sell an airplane to someone watching yt videos whats the point  lets reiterate this one more time its good to be reminded that youre not the only person to screw things up from time to time   sure we do monetization is a piece of cake a wrist tracker to detect alcohol in your sweat and texting crazy shit all over your exlist giving that some most ico are a total scam i think itd be good if  tweeted regularly about good ones dedicated  maybe the fastest way to implement at least some stats in your app and you should always collect as much data as you can is scattering ga events   yes and yes i just need a couple of months to gather stats and then im gonna document everything   n o s t a l g i a same here some companies just cant get the fact that in order to sell something they should stop selling and just fucking talk to ppl   yep most of the time i use my personal email and treat them as human beings not marketing entities   the scan looks quite gaudiish  thanks yes marketing here should be fun  they

this is the best party ive ever been in my whole life this is a fucking universe not a party  me bitching about technical issues on stack overflow   it could definitely be the case however a great deal of automation insights lies in the hands of the developer fantastic audio visual editor in js two functions to rule em all     yes but they operate in different sets of countries basically bt  stripe in that regard as the owner  all three of them rendering some processes as irrelevant typical evolution of business idea  hire  automatize  fire as a developer you have an rare opportunity to

to any niche forum 2 listen to people there 3 get the most popular threadssections there 4 you know what to do consider the following 1 go to fiverr 2 research the most popular gigs 3 read their reviews from customers 4 automatizing them sourcing ideas is easy every time you see an issue ask yourself how can i solve it using the tech i wield its all about intersections   everything is wrong when one person can do the job of a team that means their performance is shit and they pretend to be working great job okay now im really comfortable with  and can testify its awesomeness it took a month and have already saved three great fwork   both of them just reinforcing what ive said  great tech crappy ui   ga is a perfect example of a perfect tech and a state of shit ui indeed   dont get

it too whats yours  one of the worst practices in subscription interfaces is to use a cancel button to go back it should be drumroll back to avoid confusion  when i was graduating from the college ive been told that if my project made it to real life i would kill mln of ppl ah good old days   it would come and go when i own this mpb solved by buying a new one with the useless touch bar  i mean come on give us a bit of control over what we can see and especially what we cant unsee every social network has to have a mute list feature nowadays there are too many things i dont care about yes im looking at you  fiverr pro has a super attractive woman on its landing page say what you want about it but it sells   it really depends but as a general rule the more precise the targeting is the less probability of ending up with only bots i know im late to the party but that shit is fantastic    once youve got your first clients and insights you can statrying to scale or move to your next idea if thats not possible you dont even need a desktop for that you can do everything from your phone  sale tip how to test an idea with a simple instagram account   yes marketing in todays noisy world can be hard dont give up selling could be hard but its not that hard  ахахах оно the things we own define us as persons i want a social network based on that premise today i sold my hermanmiller aeron chair and when i asked for a prepay id been given it and been told the owner of such thing cant cheat  thanks honestly i think anyone can do that it has a live demo it has details it has the link it lacks public endorsement yet though there should be likes and comments ive got asked several times what a good landing page could look like here take a look   so is this like the top sm forum not a single thread more than 100k views where are all sm marketers   i mean its possible but only on a really shospan musk is a genius no doubt but his pr is bigger than him  the reason i joked about it is that im sick and tired of everyone parroting socalled 100h musks work week im calling bs on this one  haha no prob quora is a bit moody today  you should read the article the context is there but but but ive been told that theyre superhumans working 356335 hours per week what a bummer     if  had a mute list the terms handpicked and curated should be in it by default  making a curated list of curated lists  yes and trying to get insight on the real market needs in the niche  selling to ppl on fiverr the latter is a bit more complicated to be a test the less hurdles the better some ppl think that the shortest way to test an idea is to build an mvp no guys the shortest way is to go out and just sell it manually i like how fiverr can help validate an idea at no cost whatsoever its much faster than landing pages and helps attract new customers slack is beautiful but compared to telegram omg what a clumsy beast it is   but who paid for their ed its iterative reasoning  sorry missed it this one makes sense now  hi garry i built a tool to make animated quote gifs  does it have some potential in social media  2 whether or not you compete with local labor force is immensely hard to control giving the remote nature of your work  1 its not only about where you live its about the investment your country has made into you free education is one good point by   but i have two issues scientists  devs in that case if you like your dev career just because it affords you solitude youre missing out    creagif is a market test indeed but i think there is a demand for this type

device to block notifications on   thanks mate behold the placement of the hand drier done right no more puddles beneath this arrangement is ingenious colombo mall lisbon   sure but youve described the workarounds that shouldnt be needed in the first place i love how laravel has the dd function for that the most painful drawback of javascript is the length of consolelog function its much faster to splatter alerts around todays dōjō a cellarlike coworking barcelona  todays workplace in barcelona   ouch  it can be treated by not showing any reviews until the person has say at least three of them your concern is entirely valid though  i meant unless she leaves a lot of rates for a particular victim it can safely be ignored by the ranking algorithm otherwise detected  if its done here and there nothing serious if it has mass effect  detect it and ban the spammers standard algorithms   i dont have it it seems like everything is slowly getting back to normal now thanks  well im on the unpopular end of the spectrum here and mostly agree with garry  to those complaining about the crazy us tipping system there is no need to solve this issue directly robots need no tips   gonna look it up google keep charging me for a gsuite account that has been deleted long ago thats unbelievable how such big company can be so sloppy  sure and usually there is a reason why they are disappointed or angry how to fix online dating in one sentence give the ability to rate a match after the real date rank by this rate live happily ever after  i know im biased af but every time i see some heavy crime in thailand a kitten dies somewhere inside me  contacted it a day ago still no answer meanwhile my freshly published gig is still in drafts there is a big fat bug somewhere guys  cant create or update a gig is everything alright when japan meets russia this is exactly how i see globalisation  the number one priority when youre building a tool that allows ppl to design something is to prevent them making crap at any cost  yeah it totally depends on the company size and its attractiveness to the employee so true  sometimes i think that starbucks play slow music on purpose to convince me that i absolutely need another cup of coffee to speed things up  vans bags ftw their lock could be a bit softer though 90 of teapots i used still spill a few drops after use ages old tech remember this tweet when you think you cant come up with new ideas     globalization yay    definitely haha   glad you liked it thanks   yes i did but the tweet still has a typo the first occurrence of dont should be

paid in acc w what youre able to negotiate for im in a moscowspb train now at my left a 50 yo drunk indian and a russian are discussing how global weve become im almost crying  yep its less effective but less annoying too theres a reason why se penalize websites for using pop up ads despite their profitability  menu item link in preferences anything else but nagging popups mobile tip everyones learned already that when you ask rate our app next itll beg for a 5 star review dont do that its annoying product tip top places to look in for a tested idea fiverr crunchbase ifttt getapp producthunt github and by dissecting any big app embassy of russia in ireland i think theyre onto something   point it out pls  that makes some sense but still is crazy no not even a email from the ceo cmo shmo they doesnt want you marketing tip if a new user dont show up in your app anymore you dont send them more than 1 email they doesnt like you get over it any suicidal software engineers ive got a job for ya  just learned that sweden has a 30 investment tax incredible  product tip your app streams music in any way forget about audio ads in fact if your app has emotional value forget about any ads after all those stuff i tested gyokuro tea is my favourite upbeat mood without the jitters of coffee  mumbnumbbumb eh  i learned to appreciate their way of speaking with time much better than having to constantly reask some unintelligible mumbling  they were my inspiration for the tweet having all system setting set to english doesnt help whatsoever ui tip never show the localized version of your app based on the users current country if im in thailand it doesnt mean i can read thai design tip 1 never tweak the behaviour of a websites scroll bar a user has certain habits and expectations on how it should behave over the years i developed mistrust towards people in suits wearing a suit im going to treat you like you want to sell me something  wiki  free journalism this is how you disrupt dying news industry  the business model is either nonexistent or irreparably flawed to stawith   youve ironed out this  yeah having an alphabet that doesnt serve its purpose is ridiculous okay what is the most retarded law that affected you personally my bet is this   after all these years of using english ive just learned that iron is pronounced as aiun the goddamn r is silent  absolutely  yep now you can post to instagram directly from desktop   exactly the opposite just a header of a chinese news website one has to be a madman to merely suggest that the chinese should adopt latin instead of this a  yeah i missed it so much that ive spent this winter in moscow instead of chiang mai as i did for 4 years may in moscow as if i havent had enough questions about how cold russia is already  tsiolkovsky says hi to   my line of the moscow subway today adorable  the worst thing about it is that most sjw are just misled ppl doing disservice to the cause theyre fighting for zealotry is harmful   sure no one is obliged to do anything respectfully however it really helps to get your point across if one is so inclined ofc   true there is ego bolstering in either however there is a difference in the smoothness of each reply as well as the makers response   if its still vague i can elaborate further on the intricacies of the responses but doing it in 140 chars is difficult   sure just compare these two interactions also note the makers reaction on both of them    depends on the wording and the intentions publicizing smth is hard and the commentators could use some empathybolstering their egos can w8 being honest and aware of your target genders concerns also helps i absolutely love tinder people complaining about the low quality of prospective dates should learn a bit about marketing and targeting  totally agree on the sjw mob term 100 criticism zero actual input wanna criticize submit something first words are cheap  vaporwavish as hell just like bathhouses in seoul  its just hetzner servers i did all devops myself but im migrating to digital ocean  forge now its more convenient effectual entrepreneurship by  via     that wasnt even a reply they should do something ab it indeed    tinder should just make an option show people with a telegram acc only thatd be my main criterion after the gender  twitter has long ago joined medium in the shitty comment implementation club here you go i know yall are gonna like it  automatized a couple of process in my projects that required manual labor nothing beats the smell of killed jobs in the morning 2 things i like about the article how flexible mandarin is cute confidence of politicians trying to control memes  trying to split rendering to multiple cores that is sooooo accurate  you know youre a shitty programmer when you can write a function in go which is as slow as its php counterpaguess who did just that    haha dont tell my mom    true implementing these patterns and techniques in the real world is the only stresstest that really matters хороший диалог     true haha but ive stopped doing any psychedelics too bothersome and not so productive as it used to be nice username btw   its like here take a look at the possible outcomes and get your hands dirty in some real work   well yeah doing this stuff can give a few insights here and there but it doesnt substitute hard work in meditation or whatever else    they can do that felt like 90lvl meditation   ive also been stuck in a really terrible trip in which time seemed to just freaking stop breathing helps   cheesy as well but  every time i top up my mob phone balance the operator manages to jam some ads into the reposms mobile operators pls die already thanks   indeed however its healthy to

ive had one of their cocktails and now i see this little cafe due to its proximity to the sf ct station is a hub for dealmakerswhy it hasnt been disrupted by sth more fit for the job  nan my father always told me im a simple and lazy man thats why i tend to produce effective solutions as an engineer  agree with  but i think that the classification based on the country of origin gives much better results   i used a get request instead of post and that led to unpredictable behaviour when submitting long texts also got this in a chinese fortune cookie oh they know me so well  walking down the streets of sf  based on what i see here in sf id say that chiang mai is a sanfrancisco starter pack  have just fixed a mistake that was the reason my projects have been receiving a weird response from

street an ideological masterpiece now that is modern a  medium is great just the comment system sucks  today is the last day but ill have one more day after sf before going back to moscow stopped using medium comments its the most ridiculously complicated comment system ive ever seenwill return when its more like reddits  its the minimum prices per user per month free and gt500 are omitted as much as i love hong kong i have to admit that new york beats it architecturewise but the transportation of hk is still supreme   thanks somehow my userpic on ph has changed itself i mean i do love traffic but  could you please change it back  this is the pawhen i hit the spam button 10 days really  my first submission to ph as a maker price distribution for saas web services grouped by niche   and hell youre gonna need this taking into account the breakthrough keyboard in their new macbook im returning this piece of shit tmrw   thanks no i just used catalogs like capterra getapp and others how much should you charge for your softwareasaservice tool i analyzed prices from 1530 products to find out   im going to use it as a fast prototyping platform and after the project takes off move it to smth cheaper when i stathinking that its just me who makes stupid mistakes big companies come and rescue my selfesteem   thanks  thanks will take a look at it  the easiest deploy ever now my neighbours think im an asshole who like to listen lame russian pop music at full volume thank you unknown passerby my  bluetooth speaker lets anyone connect and stream anything no password asked welcome to the future internetofshit got more than 700 visitors on my article from  that made it to the top 3 on product hunt thanks   my 50 hetzner based setup would cost 200 in heroku and you know what its never been easier to pay a premium totally worth it the coolest thing about chinese is the ability of the lang to absorb not only the meaning of a donor word but also mimic its pronunciation  most operations involving humans are so freaking slow and unreliable im reminded every day why ive chosen to deal with computers not ppl   yeah either that or moscownysf  sure when we in the same city lets grab a coffee   thanks will take a look at it  more frameworks market share gt more developers gt easier to hire postgres is just because its native to heroku  good point  better compatibility when delegate easing devops and deployment  totally agree on saving moneytime on devopsdont think the traffic will be huge but dbs gonna get well over 2gb50mln rows  i hope it wont get crazy expensive thinking of migrating from codeignitermysqlhetzner_servers to laravelpostgresqlheroku any suggestionscriticism never understood the popularity of video tutorials on programming cant copypaste difficult to scroll unpleasant voices mostly  will definitely try it tonight   thanks will give it a try   but what makes it worth the switch though guys are there any reasons to learn laravel or symphony if im proficient and happy with codeigniter second that but untill some countries give up the illusion of dominance sorry russia no offence the proposition is unlikely   the developer theyve hired contacted me and tell that they paid him about 400 theyd be better off buying some beer haha  pay me to make a competitor to my own webservice thats going to cost them quite a sum getting traffic from freelance marketplaces to your projects is awesome that means theyre about to get copied  naïveté  the number one financial error people make is to mistake money for wealth culture is supreme    how well can you read japanese  спасибо если будут вопросы с удовольствием помогу  thanks will take a look at it  yes the written system of japanese was borrowed from chinese long ago from our internal intelligence the distribution of the minimal prices on smm saas software 36 data points 93 average minimal price  cant help but notice that some mandarin chars are very expressive 女 female 火 fire 人 person 木 tree 大 big 山 mountain  fantastic language  im in love with this picture  thanks will give them a try  great you already have your first customer then perhaps its some soof conspiracy but im yet to see any phrasebook or grammar app with nonretarded illustrations anything for adults   good old practice and googling specific questions  its employed by big companies mostly probably thats the reason of not so many players here i could be mistaken though  our internal data will release it soon make this for mandarin and ill buy a year subscr package heres a more or less validated idea for a saas memes with the transl and expl in foreign language you want to learn delivered daily heres the price distribution for business intelligence saas the small number of players at 020 could mean that theres an opportunity  whats the most difficult pafor you in getting off the ground and running a startup please vote and retweet  its easier for a dev to learn sales than for a sales person to learn soft engineering some areas are more difficult than others  it depends on what youd like to sell but nothing beats raw practice and googling the answers on specific questions you have you need to understand that its the job of sale people to persuade you that you need them and they are exceedingly good at it its easier to learn sales than software engineering why some devs are constantly looking for a nontech partner is still a mystery to me   true good point  but now look at this 123 or 12m 409504 or 3m the former looks bigger and more respectable to my taste  agreed on millions it works better  exactly the opposite its easier to tell 14000 from 1400 due to the length of the numbers than to notice a dot numbers are natural progress bars you dont even need to read a number to get that 14000 is bigger than 1400 dont shorten it with k  here is the traffic distribution of my last viral tech article its pretty much the same most of the time sometimes reddit kicks in tho   thanks  thanks  thanks now i see today my last article has suddenly got more than 5000 users from  any ideas why  yeah probably i should give bangkok a bit more credit but its soooo humid there my personal ranking of asian megapolises hong kong gt shanghai gt seoul gt singapore gt  bangkok gt kl gt jakarta yet to see tokyo new letter think like a hacker by       thinklikeahacker hackernoon   not yet thanks will give it a try  sure dm me startup startupmatrix   its much easier to strive to make people satisfied together with se than to try to outsmathe best engineers se have  search engines todays best seo strategy is to make your project easily accessible for se and forget about seo altogether focus on making people happy  \\\\xa0make and tell ppl how i did it   same here i just dont want to deal with the majority of investors youve 2 ideas both are 100 validated one implies inv money working 247 tons of publicity the others just a calm indie project so my second article about building a saas made it to the top stories on medium too ppl like this soof stories and i envy    its amazing how a super unsexy niche usually turns out to be one of the most stable just like in the startup world   and i guess close to 100 of thems gonna be very vocal highhorse moralists when it comes to debates  brushing teeth with a chainsaw is a bit harder than with a toothbrush but isnt quite the right thing jk pic is so true i analyzed 178 minimal prices on ecommerce software and have this distribution good for those trying to figure out the pricing in the niche   sure no prob ill let you know when im back  thanks not yet i think im going to return within a couple of months  yay screw ethics now how do you think the distribution would change if i added and youre sure noone finds out to the conditions   lots of manual labor plus some scripts to automate the parts that could be automated that pretty much sums it up about my todays launch on hackernews it was hilarious   in my opinion this is exactly what a founder should do great artists steal remember   me too im an entrepreneur after all not a priest  haha yeah   i believe that when in comes to selling the soul in the majority of cases its a matter of the price  true thats the reason ive made this poll  im interested in where this line lies on average  haha yeah you have an idea of a startup that could bring you 100kmo the idea is somewhat unethical but 100 legal whatd you do honestly an opinion on digitalnomad ism here   very controversial topic on hn on me infringing  left and right with my saas come and give me hell or suppome  a story about making my other 3700mo saas based on lamp postio   sure ill be finishing a story about postio soon and proceed to everything else my prog lang history over 16 years delphi c forth lisp c c asm php php php go php php php is it zen or degradation whenever you fancy working on a beach and feel like moving to some island recite this spell sandus in laptopus itll get better the airports still not realizing the importance of having fast and signup bs less wifi pls die thanks nothing is more satisfying than stumbling upon requests on freelance marketplaces to make a copy of your saas esp if it dominates the serp this week i talked to a lot of saas owners if i said how much of them dont collect any stats for their projects you wouldnt belive me  haha right a paof being a web developer is to notice weird numbers in your surrounding  todays workplace obviousbrag  a cafe in india uses this to get more mentions on social networks brilliant idea but they need to brand these chars a bit for full effect  dont get me wrong im really proud of my achievements but i like how sometimes india reminds me what a privileged mf i am  the top cause of death for indie startups is failure to delegate the tasks youre not good at and being overtaken by more social players mumbaikars took rat control on a whole new level  or you can just follow people you like who dont talk politics the rule mentions trump  got unfollowed works like a charm for me   no these are the days of the month i picked from one of my projects yeah its mesmerizing especially when its in real time i know you all want me to rec some music to crush it today but are too shy to ask here you go thank me later  its a custom internal system mostly combined with ga and traf stats analyzing it would make another series of articles though  the white person tax i love it being asked a lot about collecting the stats for projects  what i usually collect the answer is as much as i can here is an example  spit out your coffee and pour this into your ears instead joseph capriati knows his shit  in   in mumbai the total service charge is more than 30 is it like everywhere here  what coworking spaces in mumbai have a the most reliable connection b not closed yet like workly any area thanks    in the lt we can experience another paradigm change making this problem irrelevant or annihilate ourselves  there are two types of cities fucking slums and caring about women way to go mumbai    not in mumbai its still the easiest option here    restricting access to the data to train that ai would do the job i guess riding uber from a starbucks to a coworking space to fix bugs in my startups fill in your stereotypes  beware of the echo chamber and try to have your own ideas bemmu of candy japan 15000mo  despite being so young and my project being in a foreign language  has sent a nice chunk of traffic ih ftw   want to be a digital nomad read this first  by  digitalnomad

connection before switching from 3g that would be awesome so annoying    thanks courtland did a fantastic job we need more projects like ih just build something fast and show it to people they are the ultimate judges  of menumake 1000mo    trump is one big click machine and everyone uses it but what really bugs me is when antipopulists goes full populistic on it every time i go to hacker news i cant help but notice that the top is jam packed with some boring tasteless shit i guess im getting old holding the first apple partnership agreement 45 jobs 45 wozniak 10 wayne just 3 pages incredible  looking at apple 1 and 2 cant help but notice that this is a perfect example of an mvp and the first version of the actual product  kudos to   and  for writing these timeless masterpieces    id leave

about tweets and comments only i can imagine that itd be handy for some sensitive convos   have no idea but probably its not just me there are a lot of esl writers that want to sound less eslish  i mean on a per word basis  probably thrice this price  same for pretty much anywhere putting your wellbeing in the hands of a bunch of the countrys biggest egos is naïve madness  id pay a premium for a

dollars and banned from ny   nyag   tether  tether is blatantly lying in order to regain confidence in their scheme bitcoin whales arent falling for the lies and exited the market btc now down over 23  i have no doubt that the cftc doj or sec will be opening a huge probe into tether later this year stay tuned theres two sides to every story  nyag confirmed today that tether is a corrupt amp fraudulent scheme that deceived clients isnt backed and has no real reserves  tether tried tricking the public by pretending that this meant they were off the hook and had no wrongdoings   its very

long way to go bitcoin    people escape the unpleasant truths  by covering them with comforting lies  ny confirmed they were a fraud   a settlement means nothing to the dozens of other agencies that

it yourself    dont trust verify   heres a link to the nyag website and you can confirm it yourself        tether puts out false claims today that nyag found no finding that tether issued without backing or to impact prices and we admit to no wrongdoings  these are flat out lies as the nyag reposays the exact opposite   from the nyag repoon their website lots of misinformation from tether supporters has flooded social media regarding the recent settlement   many saying tether won and is confirmed legit  ignore all of these people they either didnt read the nyag repoor are intentionally spreading misinformation  tether has no impact on the markets fud   is that why bitcoin plunged 23 and lost 300b in the last 24 hours leading up to the nyag announcement tether makes a tweet saying they admit to no wrongdoing and will pay the settlement and everyone thinks they are legit did anyone even read the nyags probe repoit confirms everything tether truthers have been saying for years this case will 100 advance to dojsec this case was settled by nyag in order to bring it to the department of justice and securities and exchange commission   they will likely announce their lawsuits in the coming weeks or months and be a major force in taking down this confirmed fraudulent scheme today nyag confirmed tether was a fraud  in their announcement they said  tether had no access to banking  tether held no reserves   tether wasnt backed to the dollar  tether covered up massive losses  bitfinex hid massive losses live footage of tether trying to escape the authorities tick tock

means is that common  starting to wonder your intentions  what lol the sec lawsuit against ripple is clearly politically motivated and weak its no wonder sec chairman jay clayton resigned the day after they announced it xrp    maybe because he admitted on twitter to committing bank fraud   just a guess though  the securities and exchange commission sec is a corrupt federal agency that

whalecoin dont worry its totally legit  its backed 11 with rare diamonds i f  this is not true a false narrative being spread to keep eyes off tether   institutions only make up around 6 of the entire market cap and in a recent survey over 85 of institutions said they will never own bitcoin if you want to see the beautiful rainbow you need to be able to handle the storms first  just sharing the facts no need to get emotional about it      100 yes many of these loaninterest defi companies and exchanges will be shut down after tether is gone    yes of course i sent 500k whalecoins to my good

morning to everyone except the people who think screaming fud is a valid counter argument  wut lol you clearly know nothing about this investigation and scheme   the market cap means literally nothing check the volume and percent of bitcoin being bought with usdt 80   thats what happens when you create a fake supply shortage and use tether to inflate prices    after all bitconnect and virtually every other scam had prices surging before their fate too does that mean we should buy nope  i heard theyre meeting at the local slaughterhouse  this is some weird religious cult  its no coincidence that days after us regulators subpoenaed tether and bitfinex in 2017 bitcoin topped out and lost over 85 of its value in only a few months   as the nyag investigation nears its end tether is printing

an overvalued bubble propped up by corrupt and greedy criminals  i will buy more once the bubble has popped and we drop over 85   lies theyve never been audited once and even fired all their old ones they claim their work is too confusing for auditors to audit haha missing out on a pump is infinitely better than jumping in last minute and facing massive permanent losses     that isnt true at all   even michael saylor and many institutions said nobody is buying bitcoin with tether  not sure how you come to believe such lies from tether especially with no audits and hidden reserves dont be naive it will cost you a lot  when did i say i thought bitcoin wasnt real im the biggest supporter of bitcoin and been investing since it was under 200   i just think its an overvalued bubble propped up by corrupt criminals newly released footage of the surface of mars  stay around people who push you to question yourself not those who comfoyou with lies btc recent surge isnt by institutional investors

liquidated  these exchanges are like casinos the majority of retail traders are gambling with high leverage at all time highs   very risky   those who agree with me are smart  they only implemented these stress tests after 2008 and never have we seen one this high usually they are around 1015 max   i also agree the unemployment numbers they put out are fake    you too     sure here is an article       what we see in our lifetime will be hundreds of times worse than 2008   the great recession will be rebranded as the tiny recession after whats coming in the future the fed is reportedly testing

behind closed doors trust me lets not ignore the fundamentals   millions are unemployed millions of businesses shut down forever and millions still in lockdown   economic activity has faltered and the reaction from governments print unlimited money to artificially prop up the economy people are under the false impression that the assets they are holding are unsinkable   since last year the markets have moved almost completely from stimulus and fomo   these factors arent sustainable and will ultimately lead us into a major market meltdown the titanic is a perfect analogy of the global financial markets  everyone believed the titanic was unsinkable once it hit the iceberg they all ran to the top of the titanic just before it tanked  this is exactly whats happening in the markets right now

sharing my ideas common sense isnt so common     they make up less than 5 of the market and never owned any btc below 10k they are late and trying to drive up their stock prices by investing tiny portions into bitcoin   go look at mstr during the dot com bubble saylor did the exact same thing and was accused of fraud did everyone just forget how a few weeks ago he said it was almost as bullshit as fiat money   teslas sec filing doesnt include the price they bought bitcoin at or the date  people are just assuming they bought it at all time highs but they probably got in much lower

doesnt hold he is the biggest holder and everyone with a brain knows it   wtf are you talking about lol  i like how no one is mentioning the fact that over 65 billion doge is held by only 20 wallets elon owns 30 of the supply   massive pump and dump going on here will end very badly  be careful investing in doge   the dozens of celebrities shilling it are being paid what they fail to mention  rich for a reason scamming their brainwashed sheep followers   having that title shouldnt mean you just blindly follow them since the cryptocurrency markets arent regulated like the stock market is were seeing billionaires tiktokers porn stars athletes singers and actors all shilling worthless vapourware pump and dump scams to their followers   well said  be careful investing in doge   the

info from institutional investors make up less than 5 of the market  what you see on instagram or the media isnt a real depiction of the world i hope you know that   auto sales are at record lows not everyone is out buying new cars or houses   you are special however   what you said isnt true at all   bitcoin isnt my only trade i made tons with altcoins and stocks too   plus i took profit and im very happy with the gains i made on bitcoin agreeing buying the bottom in march  most certainly is   just because the stock market is being injected with trillions doesnt mean the economy is in good shape   80 of small businesses expected to close and fundamentals are the worst in 200 years   no it didnt   i have the chaopen right now    stay poor and blind   so buy it then called it   lol  its down 88 from aths  i think the top is his loss today and the bottom is his loss in total     search doge rich list  theres no exact date we can say that concludes the bull market could go higher but i would recommend slowly lowering your exposure and possibly getting stop losses  finding the exact top is the same as trying to catch a falling knife difficult   thanks for commenting  tether injecting billions into the market and speculative retail investors gambling their stimulus checks on worthless meme coins      with all due respect please work on your reading skills sir  the four most dangerous words in investing are this time its different   argument is flawed grayscale buys stuff on behalf of their clients during the 2017 peak they had record buyins and the market still dropped 85 they make absolutely no money from how the assets performs but rather from the fees and premiums    its my opinion  haha exactly unpopular opinion bitcoin will go below 7000 again in the future  same   yep he blocked me haha  lol you didnt even read it in full the entire journal is a joke and has no evidence whatsoever   no problem and here is a source so you can verify it yourself     so cme executives saying they will tame bitcoin and the exact day they launched futures dec 18th 2017 the market collapsed and that was just a coincidence  also you gotta link those articles otherwise youre just making stuff up      for bitcoin dec 18th 2017   until prices are down 90 then we can sell   its up 1500 since march  its impossible to never offend anyone  people will always find reasons to get offended to distract themselves from their own reality   there is no greater purpose than what he is doing dont feel jealous  so cme executives saying they will tame bitcoin and the exact day they launched futures dec 18th 2017 the market collapsed and that was just a coincidence ah okay thanks sir  they dont make money from holding that they make money from the fees and insanely high premiums   please do research im not arguingwith someone who has no financeecon background stick to the basics  to become wiser read more to become happier give more to become more fit move more to become wealthier spend less to become healthier eat less junk  grayscale buys what their clients want they dont own any of that eth  this is the type of misinformation that will ultimately leave many people rekt   if you check 2017 they also had record buying there we still dropped 90  respect the dump    started at the exact day bitcoin topped dec 18th    i told people to buy eth at 80 and its up over 1000  now is not the time you should be buying into this the bull market ends eventually and noobs get stuck holding dont make the same mistake ethereum cme futures statrading tomorrow eth    what does being on twitter have anything to do with investing   man youre like 15 go back to your zoom lectures and stop gambling away your parents money on dog shit   since 2017 thats new lol doge coin and these other pump and dumps have absolutely no use case   this reminds me of 2017 all over again   we saw thousands of pampds and still so many people have never learned any lessons they will learn soon   nice  i remember when bitconnect was making people money too too bad people get greedy and under the false impression that lasts it doesnt take profits  some of them on a real note i urge all of my followers to stay very far away from these meme cryptocurrencies   these celebrities shilling it are being paid what they fail to mention is how almost 65 billion doge is held by the top 20 wallets they will dump hard on the noobs who buy  were not in a bubble doge   the federal reserve and tether printing money to hold up the markets has more to do with it than profits imo  its not a bubble man were all going to be super rich   i have a post about it scheduled for tomorrow i agree with you subscribe to my newsletter whalestreet   i will be sharing cryptorelated content indepth analysis and the latest ne for those wondering the 5th step in the playbook is a harsh bear market   but this goes far beyond just crypto the everything bubble will affect dozens of markets in various sectors   all assets may be surging but only because of stimulus economic activity has faltered called it   the us has started dozens of wars to protect the dollar and people are really naive enough to think they wont obliterat    ive been in it very nice suv  cuz  uhhh take down wall street   thats good to hear in your case i think you made a good decision for taking profits but for many that sadly wont be the case they will hold it as it fizzles down to oblivion   dogecoins real value is zero it has no function and is a meme that noobs gamble on unless you got the coins for free there is still a huge risk buyingholding it imo an unprecedented global health crisis and money printing spree has produced the largest market bubble in history  dumb money has been flowing into assets at a greater rate than the great depression and dotcom bubble combined  for many this will not end well    what kind of backwards thinking is that of course it is   exactly people buying doge are financially illiterate gamblers who will end up bankrupt that is their only fate and there is no question about it  yes it was financial advice and you are broke  93k in student loans nan tiktok teen

argue with you because you clearly dont know much about this topic   what you sent is an page that lacks a breakdown of what assets are the important thing and it isnt datestamped or audited it means literally nothing   have a nice weekend  nope  okay well surely you can provide some evidence of that then im waiting  how they paid their loan to themselves   just hit a few buttons mint a few million and done   it is but the larger the ponzi the more victims and the more reasons for strict unnecessary regulations 1500000000 usdt printed in the last few days seems tether is turning their printers on high speed again                if you have internet being broke is a choice  or just open up the economy again and let people get back to work   but nvm that doesnt provide politicians

conscious decision against disclosing this investigation because you wanted the h  fud hes lying tether is legit   as their podcasts blogs exchanges and hedge funds are being sponsored by tether lol  omg they paid back the loan aka the funds they stole from users to their parent company by using the parent company to print more worthless dollars how nice of them  bitfinex and tether are owned by the same corrupt company ifinex   also for those wondering they clicked a button and printed that in 5 seconds  tether needs to be permanently removed from all big exchanges but it wont until the courts step in why   because tether makes up almost 80 of their liquidity its literally the glue holding the rigged crypto casino exchanfes together  yes those are better options fiat currencies issued by governments are rightfully despised by the crypto community   but what i dont understand is why so many put their full blind suppobehind tether a sketchy auditless centralized company that isnt fully backed and has a history of corruption ive seen dozens of crypto figures on tethers payroll try to brand those who question tether as conspiracy theorists and flatearthers    they always attack fiat currencies issued by governments but when it comes to an auditless sketchy centralized company they love it while this opinion isnt popular in todays economic climate it definitely shouldnt be overlooked    tether truthers only want transparency audits and evidence of legitimacy  dont trust verify right guys ive been investing in bitcoin for almost a decade now and will say with confidence that tether is the single biggest threat to bitcoins future  once it implodes expect a wave of harsh regulations and crackdowns which will bring crippling fear and panic to the markets

months this thread is more of a warning 8 instead of them getting direct exposure to it which wouldve been bullish the big banks want to bet on the price but not hold   this is because they will be able to artificially suppress it just like they did to gold futures in the past  7 blackrock will profit immensely from a bear market they will also be able to accumulate real cheap btc after  bitcoin

bitcoin derivatives and other assets as paof its investment scheme the futures will be cashsettled and likely on the cme btc exchange  blackrock the worlds largest asset manager with 781 trillion aum

bitcoin is correlated to the stock market  contrary to popular belief holding bitcoin will not protect your capital fro     they will flow into cash so the governments can let inflation eat away at everyones money and pay for their massive spendings  inflation is an invisible tax  they want everyone to be in cash before they allow inflation to eat it away   i expect cash is the best hold for the immediate bubble pop but definitely dont stay in it for too long the markets are all correlated  the stock market gold bitcoin and many other markets will all burst at the same time   this is due to

pit to brainwash people that theyre innocent when the evidence shows otherwise   i will only listen to someone not on the payroll of the tether scam sorry     peter is sponsored by kraken which is also sponsored by tether just saying  i like both btc and xrp   by studying past bubbles we see that the majority of traders have average buyins near the all time highs   when the btc bubble pops very few will have profited most likely insiders and a few rational investors   trade accordingly and always have a neutral perspective as the market rises you should be slowly decreasing your exposure by taking profits   unfortunately human psychology makes us do the exact opposite   when everything is green the crowd will buy in because it brings them comfo  youre absolutely right   thats why i make posts like this to remind people and prepare them for when the morning comes    what are you doing if one morning you wake up to this   yes  i know banks are urging everyone to buy into bitcoin at

is correlated to the stock market  contrary to popular belief holding bitcoin will not protect your capital from future global recessions  since btcs inception in 2009 its always had a similar trend to the dow jones index  stocks  always know whats motivating your decision to get into a trade  is it a well thought out plan with precise entry and exit rules or is it just a lust for money and a fear of missing out as a trader it is very important that you learn to be okay with your entry and exit decisions   you are rarely going to catch the exact top or bottom   as long as you have a plan

bad things happen in life you just have to keep living and not stress over what you cant control  happy new years   sorry i didnt see yes i think we will undoubtedly go under 10k again   patience   huge fan i agree with  analysis of xrp and think it will take a tumble this year   definitely going to be accumulating more the deeper we go   taking profits doesnt mean shorting with high leverage thats a big mistake and not what im recommending the most dangerous and risky bets is trying to find the exact top of the market this is the same as trying to catch a falling knife  theres a very low chance it will be done successfully few got the 2017 top  when we do top theres a strong chance it will be a blow off top things will take a turn eventually so your best option is to take profits in the green and be patient   its now more important than ever to put your emotions to the side  better to be safe than sorry the majority of traders got rekt during the 2017 bitcoin bubble   it kept going higher and higher and people kept blindly throwing money in it   when it popped at 20000 it crashed over 85 in the proceeding months  i bought in march and was actively sharing bullish calls on all assets   made atleast 250 from those calls which im very happy with   also never trade solely based on anyone else for you to put any blame on me for your trades is irresponsible and lazy stocks bitcoin and gold all hit all time highs not from organic growth but from stimulus   its not a coincidence that the entire market bottomed out in march the exact week trillions was printed   and for btc tether has seen record minting to manipulate prices up  stock markets at ath too btw   its stimulus bringing us up not organic growth like many tell themselves just because the past didnt turn out like you wanted it to doesnt mean your future cant be better than you ever imagined     i even clarified it in a follow up tweet minutes later  when prices rise it doesnt always reflect the assets true value  bitconnect is a prime example of this it rose 1000  lmao  avoid getting scammed  ive seen so many scams on twitter lately so i thought id make this tweet to quickly remind people   dont send coins to others   avoid shady exchanges   avoid mining scams   avoid crypto funds  avoid paid groups   avoid shitcoins  do research  as mentioned in my tweet usdt has the highest volume out of every pair   cmc removed it from the top of the list not fud at all usdt is 1 volume on coinbase and binance for example can you show me where that is first comes the bubble then comes the bath   derivatives are totally different from the spot market  you can clearly see spot is selected in my tweet and thats what im referring to   removed it from the top i put the fyi in the tweet so you could connect the dots but i apologize for the confusion with my wording     ok now try the spot market the pain you feel today will be the strength you will feel tomorrow  volume 000   smh  no  youre on the derivatives market listing which is totally different from what im talking about  likely yes  no worries just to clarify again i said usdt pairs   tether is still listed on cmc but usdt have been removed from the top of the trading pair list yesterday it was 1  addressing this because lots of confusion in the comment section of people saying its fud when its not   ikr   clicking the coin then clicking market  i said trading pairs not coins   i said trading pairs 10 skills that require zero talent   being on time  work ethic  putting in effobeing positive  being passionate  being teachable  being prepared  doing extra  being supportive  being kind  check yourself they removed usdt pairs  it used to be top of the list now its not even top 10   breaking coinmarketcap removes usdt pairs from website on growing concerns over tethers solvency  fyi tether is the most active trading pair and has the  highest volume in the entire cryptocurrency market  this headline is equivalent to  relax bernard madoff investment securities wont be targeted by sec says bernie madoff  in tradinginvesting its not about how much you make but how much you dont lose first comes the bubble then comes the bath      im not hating on anyone im simply warning them of the threat tether poses on the rally and how it will not last 6 daily success habits  1 plan your day the night before

and not allow anyone to sell when were at the top during market bubbles everyone thinks theyre a genius avoid pages on twitter trying to shame you for not buying in   almost the entirety of the 2017 rally was reversed after the last bubble popped i have no doubt it will happen again in 2021 when this pops tether has printed more fake dollars and injected it into btc than ever before forming yet another bitcoin bubble   with their ongoing lawsuit and expected shut down later this year this is likely their final artificially induced fomo rally before they exit   this is the same type of stuff people said during the bubble 3 years ago  lets not forget whats driving these prices up folks tether  last time it popped and corrected by over 85 their goal is to get retail to fomo in so they can exit and make billions dont get fooled  you never retire when youre doing what you love a person who lives paycheck to paycheck with no money left over between paydays will sadly work until the day they die or    bitcoin will be under 3k again    no worries i dont hold grudges        i told people to not buy   get glasses idiot    well i apologize for that then   im not looking to stabeef and i think we should both move on from this   happy new year  when prices rise it doesnt always reflect the assets true value  bitconnect is a prime example of this it rose 1000 for over a year before eventually becoming insolvent and scamming everyone for millions  greed can be blinding  breaking grayscale trust has made their largest purchase of xrp ever after scooping up another 1248 million coins on ne whats everyones goals for 2021   thanks for sharing great content   keep it up your goals shape who you become  all for that   it was fake   they released this shortly after       it is false actually      thanks christina have a great year     lets stop the tether fud before it starts is another way of saying lets stop the tether fud before sec and others stainvestigating    each star represents how many trillions they will print in 2021 brrrrrrrrrr  welcome to 2021     who said im bullish on xrp right here ive said to sell at 70 cents and simply recommend accumulating the lower we go  in fact ive said before i think it will drop more when btc nukes  yes i think it will impact most of the market  ive been paid absolutely nothing none of my tweets have told people to buy xrp and everyone can make their own decisions  im simply alerting people about the fake news claiming grayscale sold millions of xrp the other day which was just proven to be fake a grayscale spokesperson confirmed that the fund manager did not dump massive stakes of xrp and xlm  fake news claiming otherwise is being intentionally spread after a big price drop in order to create panic and fear   data shows they are in fact buying today 125m   happy new year     nope that news was confirmed to be fake according to grayscale fund manager   no problem happy new years    ive provided evidence for these purchases in the images attached to my tweet dont live for the approval of others the only person who can approve what you do is yourself  no the cases are totally different   tether is actively engaged in price manipulation and fraud   xrp is just accused of being classified as a security which doesnt really matter only really affects some tax stuff  i have no influence on the price of xrp and nowhere have i told people to buy   everyone can make their own choices im just sharing my thoughts also asian crypto exchanges delisting xrp after the sec us lawsuit just proves its a coordinated plan to create panic and fear  deepening the correction  while retail is selling at yearly lows big institutions like grayscale trust are purchasing millions of xrp i guarantee that in the future these exchanges will all relist xrp    the sec lawsuit isnt a death sentence for xrp like many bitcoin maximalists have painted it to be   it will provide clarity for the entire space and once done will boost investors confidence in xrp   would love to see it   nothing but truth  no worries     its possible  yep  youre reading the data wrong 876m is the value of the xrp which has obviously dropped a lot   if you look at the number of xrp they hold they repurchased a large portion today   nah i like bitcoin a lot  both move in a similar direction  breaking grayscale trust has made their largest purchase of xrp ever after scooping up another 1248 million coins on new years eve after massive panic sell off   have an amazing year    dont tell people your dreams show them  exactly  probably jealous not sure the day tether is shut down    bitcoin amp alts will nosedive   exchanges will freeze assets  millions will try to sell     seen like 10 big pages spread fud about me trying to ruin my reputation with fake rumours as i share the truth on tether and other scandals  my response get a life its new years go spend time with your family and stop crying like a bitch on twitter    happy new year pomp   happy new year everyone wishing you all a safe and prosperous 2021      huh   nope  lets let the sec decide that lol   he has absolutely no say in what they do imagine bernie madoff telling investors the fbi wont go after me uhhh yes they will  if you look at the fundamentals and whats driving the prices up its clear bitcoin is forming another bubble and will drop another 8090 once it pops   many are blindly jumping in at 28k because the fake money printer machine known as tether is manipulating everything  we lose much more money from taxation than inflation but overall i agree lower taxes and stop the handouts    just breathe its going to be alright  being honest isnt negative the average american will pay roughly 400000 in taxes to the government during their lifetime   yet the government is struggling to even agree on providing them with a 600 stimulus check which equals around 164 each day      you really think my tweets have any influence on a 500 billion dollar cryptocurrency    you clearly dont understand its function over 80 of bitcoin is bought with tether which is backed by nothing   i suggest doing research into how theyre manipulating the market breaking us regulators are considering new legislation that will define stablecoins as security if the bill is adopted  true but this battle wont be hard tether is a centralized company that is creating counterfeit dollars they can easily take them down in a second when they decide too  im sure theres people at the top intentionally delaying the case so they can maximize their own positions   where did you pull this number from because its not even remotely accurate the us has started dozens of wars to protect the dollar and people are really naive enough to think they wont obliterate tether from existence  this counterfeit scams only function is to inject into bitcoin create a parabolic rise get retail to fomo then exit the market   hes obviously insane but in a good way   not how it works   yep and id say sub 1k which is me quoting the leaked conversations from bitfinex executives    theres a memo of them admitting to it back in 2018 they knew the markets would tumble if they didnt turn the printers back on brrrrrrr the two most powerful warriors are patience and time  haha  always be your best self and people will be drawn to you   its not about being the most popular its about being kind humble and real  i dont think you understand it fully   tether is manipulating btc up by injecting fake dollars similar to what the fed does in the stock market   bitcoins price would crash hard just as it did in 2018 when these fears started from their huge lawsuit  lol no  i am a huge supporter of bitcoin itself and think its an amazing long term investment however i do also see the dooming threat the tether scheme poses they could fall victim to it too   many elites and well known people fell victim to theranos scam they arent immune  no one is always right im no prophet or saint but i try my best to help others   sorry i couldnt meet your expectations   happy holidays   they invested less than 15 in and look at the months of media publicity they got very smaits boosted their stock prices up and made them thousands of times more than any btc investment would   if you dont plan on trading it for sure   its always safer to hold it on a wallet   i have some of both i dont think they will drop when tether does  great no problem  usdt is not safe the best bet would be to take profits on any btc eth or other tether injected coin send it to your bank and wait for the purge   this is my opinion but obviously you can do whatever you want   i really do not trust cz i was very respectful of him but unfortunately he blocked me after i politely asked him to stop adding scam coins to his exchange  when they take out tether i am certain it will affect more than just bitcoin   thanks for sharing      i dont know the exact date for when the tether case will be finalized no one does except the few people involved with it likely in 2021 the day tether is shut down    bitcoin amp alts will nosedive   exchanges will freeze assets  millions will try to sell   transactional gridlock   fear will consume the markets  it will be a bloodbath for the crypto markets and sadly not many are prepared for this   good times are coming  have patience    11000000th   i said considering in the tweet   thanks      no     this is the largest scheme in history   them not going after tether makes absolutely no sense it also wont be that expensive theres tons of evidence of fraud and money laundering   a hong kong firm that happens to be creating tether fake us dollars   they will definitely go after them no matter what country they hide in     haha   corrupt cryptocurrency exchanges will commonly use a hack as an excuse for stealing investors funds   i wont be surprised if some big crypto exchanges see massive fake hacks in 2021 as regulators begin cracking down on their illegal activities breaking us regulators are considering new legislation that will define stablecoins as security if the bill is adopted tether will likely face a lawsuit from the sec  congratulations love your movies         a person generally hates you for 3 reasons   1 they want to be you   2 they hate themselves   3 they see you as a threat lets finally put this xrp debate to rest  donated another 50000 to barstoolfund today thank you  for setting this up     he blocked me lol  what do you think some of elon musks laws would be ive seen a big rise in cryptocurrency scams over the last few months this is just a friendly reminder to always stay vigilant and never trust anyone   if you have any tips or recommendations to help others avoid being scammed please share them below   people dont like talking about the tether one because it disrupts the entire narrative that btc is being pushed up through natural institutional and retail adoption and demand they want fitness with no exercise they want clarity with no selfreflection they want talent with no efforts they want love with no commitment they want trust with no transparency they want wealth with no longterm thinking  you want something pay the price    i do not have any xrp ive also told people to sell at 70 cents no need to spread misinformation  just fud right     aum  holdings   the value of xrp dropped rapidly therefore so did the percent of their holdings which is shown in that   tether was there during the first bull run when you feel emotional always give yourself a good night of sleep before taking any decision   why do you lie i did no such thing  stay safe    tether isnt real money so nowhere  that makes no sense but agree to disagree  its on their twitter page   not satoshi just some random guy quantitative easing is socialism for the rich successful people do less   complaining   blaming   arguing   bragging   resenting   yelling   interrupting   taking   judging   lying  hating  i never tweet hateful stuff  things to remember when people hate on you  1 misery loves company  2 people oppose progress  3 hupeople hupeople  4 opinions dont define reality  5 hatred means that you lack love  6 hating is a waste of precious time  7 judgements are a confession of character every time you place a trade you are up against   price manipulation  misinformation  lack of liquidity  fear of missing out  bots and algorithms   your own emotions  other experienced traders  whats your plan china will end this year as the only major country in the world to see its economy grow rather than shrink   china has never been stronger  as a result of the global pandemic    they sold some in november and are re purchasing some more at this deep discount  that one you showed is a few weeks old whereas the one i showed is from yesterday  thanks for more crypto news like this be sure to follow my page if you havent yet    i post daily news calls tafa analysis and educational information regarding stock  crypto investing   thanks happy holidays  breaking grayscale has increased their xrp position by 85 after prices plunge to a 6 month low   no worries it wasnt hostile   happy holidays  not the only i really like btc eth neo eos xlm and many more   i just think theyre all very overvalued and not worth buying yet which is why i never shill any coins  bitcoin dropped 70 in 2018 when the news of tether being a scam started circulating  when did i shill xrp i never told anyone to buy i said to accumulate cheaper not at 30 cents or 70 cents   youre only in profit when you take profit   i guarantee you with my life that few of them will anywhere above 10k is a terrible buy in  thats wrong the money is injected into btcs marketcap    im assuming around 70   tether is a scam which is manipulating the prices of btc eth and others up   they are backed by nothing and theres a huge inside scheme with many top exchanges   none of which will be around in the future biggest ponzi of our lifetime  im not bullish on xrp this year  ive not once told people to buy anywhere above 30 cents my last buy call was in march but i got out very high   ive been advising people to wait for cheap prices to accumulate  fomo  dumb money is buying up here remember when they were all buying at the 2017 high   btc then corrected over 85 xrp lost 70 of its value in a few days from some allegations in a 13 billion lawsuit   imagine how much the markets will fall when tether goes bust from their 14 trillion lawsuit   that lawsuit is over 100000 larger and will nuke bitcoin\\\\xa0and alts down 8090    you trust china breaking nearly half a million residents in wuhan may have been infected with covid19  almost 10 times its official number of confirmed cases according to a study by the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc     no when tether goes down it confirms that btc is being propped up by fake money btc will crash harder than anything weve ever seen before   yep and add in big regulations  nvm    i dont have to agree with you to like you or respect you   yes  love it  night  this is a vital lesson to the xrp community  when xrp was surging and hit 70 cents i saw many traders get fomo and buy   tether isnt backed by anything its a scam  yes thats a better coin crypto investing is 95 about controlling your emotions   the other half is patience  exactly everyone said tesla was going to fail and drop to zero in 2018 after elon musk was sued by sec for securities fraud  the corporate profits are plunging while markets are surging this will not end well   streams nice keep up the great work  whats his name again i already forgot 6 daily success habits  1 plan your day the night before 2 set up a morning routine 3 spend some alone time thinking 4 read at least 30 minutes 5 exercise 6 practice gratitude the crypto markets arent rising through natural demand   they are rising through market manipulation and it will inevit tether is the federal reserve of crypto    can you prove tether is backed 11 with the dollar  unless you have secret access to their reserves that are hidden from the public and in some shady bank account in the cayman islands its impossible   their wont be a payout to that size but rather an insolvency of tether and other massive fines   and what did you expect the scam exchange to just admit the accusations   bernie madoff denied his lawsuit for months before finally ending up life in prison  great work    i agree with you completely   tetherbitfinex has absolutely no legal defence hence why theyre pumping the living hell out of btc and likely planning a big exit   anyone with any legal background knows that tether has no chances of success in the lawsuit accept your past without regret handle your present with confidence and face your future without fear  mistype i spotted it a second after i clicked send       i think him being him is whats kept it afloat for so long many like him but dont understand the company   tesla isnt that profitable they certainty arent truly the most valuable car company in the world which many think because of the bubble   i think tesla is very overvalued and will ultimately drop  using leverage while shorting is obviously highly risky but shorting in general will pay off only recommended for patient investors  im sorry you feel that way youre not forced to follow me if you disagree with what i say  everyone said tesla was going to fail and drop to zero in 2018 after elon musk was sued by sec for securities fraud  the exact same thing is happening right now with xrp   we are 100 going below 20000 again  i will make a bet of 1m with you on that   they have no defence according to people close to the case they know they will be busted and are just using all their resources for their final pump then exit thats my guess in my whole life i have known no wise people who didnt read all the time none zero youd be amazed at how much warren reads and at how much i read my children laugh at me they think im a book with a couple of legs sticking out   charlie munger  just looking out for my bulls    my hypothesis isnt wrong ive said from the stathat tether is manipulating the prices up   the more we rise means the more we will crash sure i didnt expect them to print that much but i am still very confident tether will go insolvent   just my opinion though  very true  yep my mistake     whatever gets the likes am i right 50000 milestone reached   i want to personally thank each and every one of you who follows me and constantly supports my page   i started twitter almost 10 years ago and from day 1 ive always been driven to help others   im glad people are enjoying my content    im not sure what youre taking about  yes i think its much safer  yes i do and thanks   they arent backed 11 with the us dollar they changed their website to say backed by reserves which is all hidden on some sketchy offshore bank account not transparent at all  no i dont think it will   not fake it takes like 5 seconds to google it and verify it yourself  the 14 trillion lawsuit against tether is over 1000 larger than xrps tiny 13b sec lawsuit   yet people are worried about xrp falling to zero  dont rush the process good things take time youve got to keep working and stay patient   bitcoin has a higher market cap than every bank in the entire world    today bitcoin is also now the largest financial service in the world with the market cap surpassing visa    putting 1 of ones portfolio in btc and 99 in cash only for publicity  stock growth purposes isnt a long term pro for btc   most big players have been in pre 2015 anyone getting in now is late to the game and trying to use the hype for company self interests the crypto markets arent rising through natural demand   they are rising through market manipulation and it will inevitably pop just like in 2017  remain calm and dont fall into the trap they are artificially creating fomo with fake dollars so people invest real dollars  im only 400 followers away from reaching 50000 followers this is a huge milestone for me and im beyond grateful to

this year   sure i couldve made a bit more but being too greedy never works out   and finally perma bulls havent made anything yet until you actually take profits your roi is 0  yes  no  the rise of the killer robots if youre a long term bitcoin investor like me your main objective is to get an average buy in as low as possible   the best option for the long run will be to wait for a big correction and slowly dca in  being patient and controlling your emotions is essential everyone knows were going to see a massive blowoff top with bitcoin but the problem is nobody knows exactly when   this uncertainty and speculation mixed with price manipulation is whats making the prices skyrocket   that isnt daves twitter account its a scam impersonator and you should block them   also do not

will be sharing with you all in 2021 stay tuned because i know you will enjoy it the billions in fake tether injections have artificially pushed bitcoins price so high that retail investors are blindly buying in at aths in fear of missing out  this will undoubtedly end in the same way the 2017 bitcoin bubble ended and have a major retracement    he has me on the updated one  tip of the day when you look back on 2020 dont think of it as a year of pain but a year of growth you made it through each day you should be proud of yourself you are a better you despite all the hardships take a

growth no trauma no depth no honesty no clarity no trust no friendship no disciplin  yep and tether has a much larger lawsuit once they are done it will be a major hit to the crypto markets the sec lawsuit fears will likely ripple across the markets and impact other cryptocurrencies  while xrp is the current target that doesnt mean other coins are off the hook   theres thousands of coins that violate sec rules and i think investors will flee as fears arise  i agree completely   this sec lawsuit will ripple across the markets and likely impact other cryptocurrencies  nice prediction   ive already had covid and will not be getting the vaccine but i am worried about the long term side effects on the population   i think more testing should be done to ensure its 100 safe hundreds of millions are expected to take this and all human life is indispensable  thank you and yes the things holding it up now arent sustainable and we will likely see another big correction  remain patient and calm the time will come most vaccinations take many decades to be fully tested and ready for human use   the covid19 vaccine however took a total of 4 months which is why many are worried about its safety  finding the exact bottom will be difficult but when bitcoin corrects we could see a very large price correction on all alt coins  xrp could easily crash below 15 cents next year and while many will get scared and sell in fear i will be slowly dollar cost averaging in after this sec lawsuit news xrp has erased all of its gains from that pump which goes to show you how quickly peoples sentiments can change  my thoughts on xrp are the exact same its a very promising coin but you should be accumulating it as low as possible this is a vital lesson to the xrp community  when xrp was surging and hit 70 cents i saw many traders get fomo and buy in at the top   i was urging people to avoid buying in after a 250 pump and told them to wait till we drop lower to accumulate       thanks   never base your investment decisions on what the media is saying they often use shady tactics to make money  who else remembers when they kept telling everyone to buy xrp at all time highs in

100x leverage feature to help investors become more profitable   they added it because they knew how many traders would gamble and get liquidated   exchanges make their millions in profit mainly from inexperienced leveragers inflation is silently robbing you of your purchasing power  have you ever wondered why the prices of things in the store are always rising   every day billions of dollars are being printed and driving the value of your currency down   oh yeah   appreciate it   have a great weekend   i dont care    were in a pandemic and every nation on earth is under pressure   capitalism has brought more prosperity than any ideology in history   if you dislike it so much go to venezuela where people are starving have no freedoms and use their currency as toilet paper  any fool can criticize condemn and complain but it takes character and selfcontrol to be understanding and forgiving  my tweet has literally zero affect on bitcoin im a huge fan but the main message is to buy low and not fomo in when things are green    thats aright theres still one below 10k according to that thing youre using    yeah youre right its probably nothing keep buying up here            capitalism has consistently lifted millions from poverty but is derided as cruel and heartless  while socialism has consistently consigned millions to death and squalor but is praised as fair and compassionate  your messages are kind though   day trading is unprofitable for 90 of people mostly inexperienced retail who partake in it which only supports my point   investing is preferable for people who want to make money not gamble away their pay checks do you think warren buffet or any other great investor is staring at the minute charts every single day   if youve done     ponziiiii are you a fomo trader

claim to be backed by 1 usd anymore   they changed the wording on their website to be backed by their reserves which are private lol  yes fortunately tether will not be solvent forever       im here for you            you too   no i prefer actual facts not some magical rainbow chathat gets altered every 6 months when its wrong not a coincidence tether bitcoin  trading is complex if you do not

using it   i would not recommend it on any accounts considering how speculative and volatile this asset is    those tools are very risky and mainly directed to inexperienced and greedy investors which

others what you know 5 analyze objectively 6 practice humility 7 respect constructive criticism 8 take initiative 9 love what you do banks on bitcoin  notice how these predictions of 100k to 500k from some of the largest banks are intentionally shared a nan  yes what rich people dont want you to know  1 you wont get rich off a salary alone 2 inflation steals your wealth so invest 3 buy assets not liabilities 4 never spend more than you make 5 pay yourself first always 6 compound interest works wonders  its not sustainable its not real demand and ended horribly 3 years ago after they stopped printing  over 6t pumped into stocks this year trillions in stimulus to businesses and citizens across the world and even tether stimulus for bitcoin the riskiest thing in the world is the belief theres no risk  by the same token the safest and most rewarding time to buy usually comes when everyone is convinced theres no hope   thanks    glad we have some rational thinking going on  if your risk exposure is too big fear will override any rational thinking  there isnt when are people going to realize that every market is extremely overvalued  the economy is in ruins and stimulus is at levels weve never seen in history   thats why weve went up not some fundamental demand shift that the media is trying to justify it with nan  it will likely follow bitcoin im personally waiting to buy in at a cheaper price panic and confusion are contagious  do your best to stay focused rational and in control  thats where your edge lies   pandemic or not the economy is in ruins and every asset is near all time highs very overvalued bubble  were up over 350 from march lows  now is still very overpriced   buy when were back below 4k  people love to make up rumors about me for two reasons  1 my market sentiment isnt the most popular  2 ive been exposing scammers for years  they feel attacked   i just ignore any hate and thank you if you give a fool money it will soon end up in the hands of someone who knows how to use it  the rich get richer as it is so try not to make it easier for them with pathetic spending and borrowing habits  morning  happy thanksgiving     ive already shared it on twitter before  very shady exchange   too bad  never reached out to me i have tons of evidence of corruption and price manipulation  leaked lol coinbase claims the new york times is planning to publish a negative story about the exchange at some point within the next few days    this is their attempt at damage control im assuming the article will expose significant flaws if they had to warn clients beforehand    of course  a paypal user reports their account has been restricted for 6 months after they tried trading crypto using the platform      who uses microstrategy in the first place no one knew about them before bitcoin  why would you follow if you dont like my content   have a safe flight charles   lol happy thanksgiving  judgment comes from clear thinking the clear thinking comes from having time to reflect and to pursue your genuine intellectual curiosity      he did the same during the last bubble lol  anyone can be a merchant amazon  anyone can be a taxi driver uber

temperament its a test of how well you can sit quietly when your emotions are screaming at you  justin suns tron has 10b users   didnt you hear       right about 1 thing and wrong about 9000 other things doesnt equal 100   he said it would hit 200 last year and has probably over a dozen conflicting calls about it lol never ask a barber if you need a haircut  warren buffett  never ask a fund manager politician institution media organization or bank if its the right time to buy or sell  nice profile pic    awesome   true its like an amuseum     if you never sell you never profit     there is tons of proof so much that tether has requested to delay the lawsuits   i guarantee youve never even done any research into this   read this and come back   people hate hearing things that go against their beliefs  i have no doubt that bitcoin will revisit ranges like 10k and lower again in the future   people are so caught up in the hype they forget to remember how manipulated this coin is   control your emotions buy low and sell high simple  im a huge fan of bitcoin but youre ignoring a huge factor for the price increase which is tether   theyve printed record amounts of fake money since march more than ever before   they print fake dollars buy bitcoin prices rise retail fomos markets correct 7085   hes a scam artist hes shilled dozens of rug pulls to his followers and when i called him out on it he tried deflecting and calling me a scammer   note ive never asked for money ever and never shilled a coin in my life  not you you make good videos   people like to think that we have a democratic system but there is nothing democratic about the federal reserve  unelected unaccountable central planners from a private central bank run our financial system and manage our economy  no life is tough   if you win fine if you dont the world moves on   many will fail many will quit life does not stop for a second because of your peculiar circumstance   its why you have to relentlessly push yourself and force your will upon this world   good point  youll lose much more trying to long it sitting on the sidelines is good too waiting for the perfect moment to buy in after a large correction will be rewarding you are back in 2010  you have 30 seconds to write down a note to yourself   given your current knowledge and wisdom what advice do you give  true instead of baby showers lets host business showers when a friend starts a business we all come together  congratulate them amp bring resources for their business   elon musk   i was going to say that in my tweet   yep  youll never see these type of bitcoin headlines in march when we were at 3800     that completely voids the purpose of bitcoin lol   having it held by a centralized company with insanely high fees offers absolutely no benefit  word count    he literally gets paid from the fomo and mass liquidation purge that follows corrupt criminal  nice tweets i agree with them all   good to see some common sense on my timeline rather than some dog telling his followers were heading to 1 million  lol  anyone can be a merchant amazon  anyone can be a taxi driver uber  anyone can be a journalist twitter  anyone can be a bank bitcoin  anyone can be a movie director youtube  anyone can be a hotel owner airbnb  anyone can learn wikipedia  dear internet thank you  people actually invest in this shit   did the wealth stay in btc during the last bubble in 2017 we lost over 250 billion lol  read it earlier very true     motivation is the easy pathis is why everyone you know has goals and plans they hope to accomplish   what differentiates the winners from everyone else is the extent of commitment  obsessiveness is what gets you ahead pushing forward daily in faith for the future  iill get some water pplease    thank you theres no evidence they are its just false rumours circulating to get retail to buy the top   same thing happened with silver during its last bubble everyone said they were buying all the supply but it was all a lie  yep  not bad if i had to pick any coffees it probably would be those haha  i beg youif for any reason you do not like me please unfollow me   im tired of weeding through rude comments amp dms  i like their sandwiches  that cookie looks good too   i dont drink coffee or anything so thats basically it    yum    miners overselling didnt cause the bubble to pop wall street did   they day it topped out was the exact day cme futures were added to the market   wall street corporations opened billions in shorts and profited from its 85 drawdown quantitative easing is just like a drug addict needing more and more just to maintain a level and avoid a crash   yes we will likely see more   think of stimulus as heroin to a drug addict each time they need a bigger dose to feel the effects   at one point in the future no amount of injections will be able to hold up the markets    wow so sad im confident we will pull through so i dont want you to worry stay strong thank you everyone for your kind wishes were still feeling sick but its very nice reading your comments   appreciate each and every one of you  i dont tweet negative stuff only positivity  pump and dump its crazy to think that 2021 is only about a month away exciting   2021 and based on the idea that we were ranging below 4000 just earlier this year and only bounced due to global stimulus unsustainable and unnatural i think theres a possible we go lower    bold prediction i know but it only makes sense also cme gaps there too  it will eventually few people learned that in 2017 anyone around remembers that this level of euphoria is identical and the reasons for the pump are too dont forget that this rally is from tether injecting fake dollars to manipulate btc to cause fomo  similar to what the fed does in the stock market not sustainable  the reason im un phased is because im confident we will see a big reversal eventually a ticking time bomb with bitcoin and other alt coins you plan on holding for the long run your main goal should be to get an average buy in as low as possible   most traders are victims to their emotions and will consequently jump in at the all time highs  bull market induced by printed tethers isnt sustainable   the higher we go the lower we will drop in my opinion intelligent investors try to separate their emotions of hope fear amp greed from their trust in reason   that wisdom will prevail over time  thanks  ive had many tweets telling people to accumulate the lower we dropped from august   you will always fail at trading if you blame all your mistakes on others   take responsibility and make your own trades never rely on others   have a nice night theres a direct correlation between fomo and experience  new investors think they need to get on every runner incase its the last one people with experience understand opportunities never run out  whatever you missed today will present itself in the not too distant

rarely see any pages call out these scams so i figured i would    every big page that makes noise will get hate even if you had a 100 strike rate a few people would still complain    think of it as a compliment they are so sad with their own lives they spent it focused on you   keep it up  winners take full responsibility for their actions  losers blame others for their failures    yep most defi

bankers are coming to save them    they will make their own coins and try to replace btc   dont be so naive people  banks on bitcoin  notice how these predictions of 100k to 500k from some of the largest banks are intentionally shared after bitcoin is near all time highs    they want to create fomo then dump their bags on dumb retail investors who jumped in late   when banks put out predictions like this you should be nervous   telling everyone to sell at lows then telling them to buy in at highs it wasnt a mistake   this is how they make their money from dumb retail who will

your calculation of its intrinsic value thats hard but if you can buy a few great companies then you can sit on your ass thats a good thing 29 move only when you have the advantageyou have to understand the odds and have the discipline to bet only when the odds are in your favor 27 an isolated example thats very rare is much easier to endure than a perfect sea of misery that never ceases  28 favorable surprises are easy to handle its the unfavorable surprises that cause the trouble 26 in terms of business mistakes that ive seen over a long lifetime i would say that trying to minimize taxes too much is one of the great standard causes of really dumb mistakes anytime somebody offers you a tax shelter from here on in life my advice would be dont buy it 25 its waiting that helps you as an investor and a lot of people just cant stand to wait 24 i know one guy hes extremely smaamp a capable investor i asked him what returns do you tell your clients you will earn for them he said 20 he knows thats impossible but he said charlie if i gave them a lower number they wouldnt give me money to invest 23 smapeople arent exempt from professional disasters from overconfidence 22 where you have complexity by nature you can have fraud and mistakes this will always be true of financial companies including ones run by governments if you want accurate numbers from financial companies youre in the wrong world 21 i think that every time you see the word ebitda you should substitute the word bullshit earnings 20 it is a fact that great and foolish excess can come into prices of common stocks in the aggregate they are valued partly like bonds based on roughly rational projections of use value in producing future cash but they are also valued partly like rembrandt paintings 19 i succeeded because i have a long attention span 18 thanks to the early 1930s and the behavior of the capitalists in the robberbaron days stocks yielded dividends twice as much as the interest rates on bonds it was a wonderful period to be buying stocks we profited from others demoralization from the previous generation 17 the way to get rich is to keep 10 million in your checking account in case a good deal comes along 16 if you like me lived through 197374 or even the early 1990s there was a waiting list to get out of the country clubthats when you know things are tough if you live long enough youll see it 15 ive never been able to predict accurately i dont make money predicting accurately we just tend to get into good businesses and stay there 13 you should remember that good ideas are rarewhen the odds are greatly in your favor bet heavily  14 mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean 10 in the corporate world if you have analysts due diligence and no horse sense youve just described hell  11 youre looking for a mispriced gamble thats what investing is and you have to know enough to know whether the gamble is mispriced thats value investing 8 sit on your ass investing youre paying less to brokers youre listening to less nonsense and if it works the tax system gives you an extra one two or three percentage points per annum  9 acknowledging what you dont know is the dawning of wisdom 7 ben graham had a lot to learn as an investor his ideas of how to value companies were all shaped by how the great crash and the depression almost destroyed him it left him with an aftermath of fear for the rest of his life and his methods were designed to keep that at bay 6 once wed gotten over the hurdle of recognizing that a thing could be a bargain based on quantitative measures that would have horrified graham we started thinking about better businesses 4 life in pais like a poker game wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a muchloved handyou must learn to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds  5 my idea of shooting a fish in a barrel is draining the barrel first 3 people are trying to be smartall i am trying to do is not to be idiotic but its harder than most people think thread  here are 30 mustread quotes from charlie munger one of the most successful investors in the world  1 the desire to get rich fast is pretty dangerous  2 knowing what you dont know is more useful than being brilliant   how am i angry i respect you a lot and ive not said any insults and nor have you which i truly appreciate   im sorry you interpreted it as that  have a nice weekend  did you read the thread the other stable coins are mostly regulated   tether is not they are injecting fake money to manipulate the prices   i suppoother stable coins but tether is a scam and you will see soon do more research   check the evidence yourself and dont rely on the courts to tell you whats happening or youll be reacting to the news with everyone else  shoit with what tether hmm sometimes people dont want to hear the truth because they dont want their illusions destroyed   oh okay  the agenda is to expose this fraud and have it shut down   it has a bad impact on adoption and could permanently leave bitcoin in a tailspin if enough damage is done   and we will see thanks for sharing   bitcoin is going up because tether has an unlimited supply they can essentially print new fake dollars and buy up bitcoin causing the prices to rise like were seeing   once that scheme ends it will end lots of artificially growth in the markets since 2014  whoever said that is wrong in every way ive talked with the plaintiffs and they want to shut it down   also tether is not backed by the usd they dont show any of their reserves publicly and have even removed that false claim from their website  no idea i know some people very close to the case and they say tether will be done but dont have any estimated dates   it all depends on how quickly the courts process the information   tether has also asked for many postpones to delay the case  of course   this fomo is what makes institutions rich its not sustainable by any means but they will pretend it is only to dump on them   its a repeat of 2017 and its exciting  no exactly   lets say someone has 5000 usdt in their wallet that 5000 usdt is actually worth zero   once this has been exposed no one will sell their bitcoin for tether the pair will be dead and have no orders    no trades can be placed  they must go through the courts   thats how the law works unfortunately and it can be a timely matter   its best to be patient you should read the case if you have time its really interesting      that has no effect on btc   this is price manipulation on a grand scale and its amazing to watch   once weve gone high enough they will pull the rug and things will tumble no one knows when but it will happen eventually   i urge everyone to remain vigilant and know the risks of the market tether is a ticking time bomb   its been strategically implemented in every big exchange and has control over the market prices   once they stop minting or are finally shut down we will drop as fast as we went up fear will consume bitcoin this is the same thing that caused the 2017 bitcoin bubble  after many jumped in at the top at 20k over 250 billion dollars was removed from the markets   and prices tumbled to 3k lows in under 12 months why do you think tether has the most volume on the market  why do you think btc pumps immediately after tether is minted   why do you think during the months in 2019 tether stopped printing we dropped 75   why do you think tether doesnt make their reserves public bitcoin is rising rapidly due to record amounts of tether being minted daily  anyone whos read the lawsuit knows tether will be shut down they have no defence and are up against irrefutable evidence  when this tether bubble pops we will easily go to 10000 and lower  binance manipulation ft tether after  bitmex and okex     fear of failure ensures failure  beautiful     beautiful have a great weekend everyone   five valuable\\\\xa0investing truths\\\\xa0    compounding takes time  valuations are unpredictable  simple is usually better t  yeah its kinda slow i wish there was an option to disable it but its whatever trading results have to be looked at from a long term perspective or you will lose confidence in your system in a tough market   hes made like 70 accounts to comment this propaganda on my page haha it takes me a second to block and i get a good laugh out of it   he thinks hes doing harm but i actually encourage it its hilarious stocks bitcoin gold and many other assets are hovering around all time highs   weve also seen the largest increase in retail investors this year 1200  it sure would be a shame if they all got rug pulled at the top as the everything bubble bursts     fuck off  exactly  have a great weekend     fair its just an estimate but as you mentioned im no time traveller im just sharing my opinion and understand it may be later than 12 months  i agree with you which is why ive said it wont be effective in the long run   but realistically they can shut down exchanges and view everyones actions on the internet which would be big  it was seen as a challenge with gold but it still happened regardless  not really 34 companies buying in isnt mainstream  i called it a prediction for a reason its based on an educated guess based on how governments act   they are power hungry and will take control whenever they can theyve done it in the past as mentioned in the thread and will likely in the future  yep    i understand it will never go to 1000 or whatever some people say but theres still a long term upside that would bring nice gains  yep and finish the thread i said it wont stop its long term growth  most cryptos are scams that just simply wont be around in 12 months  youre absolutely right   bitcoin is a great store of value but fails in respect to being utilized for payments   this is why im a fan of xrp and think it will outperform many coins in the long term   im a fan of gold and btc   the whole narrative with gold flipping into btc was created by greyscale and other institutional firms  its a marketing scheme  dropgold  and not anything realistic gold will hold strong  exactly people need to be realistic for once and not get delusional solely because a centralized scam tether is pumping the prices  bitcoin has been the talk of governments since it was first created   with over 300 billion inside the crypto markets i think its definitely gotten their attention and no i dont think it will be an effective law from governments  bitcoin doesnt care about laws   while it might negatively impact the prices in the shoterm i dont think it will stop bitcoin from succeeding in the long run  i never said thats what i think   im saying thats what the governments will say  thanks and i agree with you   i never said this will stop bitcoin    btc cannot be stopped by any laws  good point they will likely use climate change as a justification as well something similar happened in 1933 with gold as confidence in banks declined significantly  following the great depression the us criminalized owning gold   they saw it as a big threat to  economic growth and wanted people more confident dependant on banks  prediction within the next 12 months a global superpower will create laws that criminalize bitcoin ownership   they will cite the following as their justifications    terrorism financing   money laundering   tax evasion  darknet markets   cyber crime why do we pay taxes when the fed can just print unlimited amounts of money   we are essentially paying for ourselves to b  best intro on youtube           have a great weekend  a nice tiny gift after stealing their trillions of dollars in resources  really happy to hear that  1 get

2017 was that bullish  no they arent grayscale is an investment fund which doesnt buy or own anything their clients do    dont be misled by fake news when the entire world goes into lockdown again no amount of stimulus will be able to hold up the economy   they are true however and theres substantial evidence which will be bad for tethers defence   thats why im talking about it now its important to consider especially before the crowd catches on  thats crazy how he survived that  im helping others not buy in at the top and get fucked   if you think we will surpass 20k then you should go all in now take out some loans too be cautious when you see these billionaire boomers on tv telling you to buy into btc at yearly highs   many of them bo  sometimes the facts are hard to swallow by the crowd because it goes against their narrative  yes   it is ok to disagree with people about things it makes the world interesting   but having different opinions or views to somebody else doesnt mean

following it for long because youd know it was a failure for a long time   it said we would be at 200k by 2019 it said last year we would never be under 6k again both wrong   those are your facts  no problem rule 1 fuck what they think  look at the prices prior to when tether was introduced then look at a graph of their marketcap or injections and youll see how influential they are  because it goes against the narrative   it means the market is fully manipulated and not derived from real demand   of course no one will talk about it  your argument is bitcoin is a buy because billionaires and tech moguls said too   that isnt much of an argument   they also got in at pennies they love the fomo and will dump on retail youll see  time will tell all   you really cant think for yourself you need some billionaires to make decisions for you   good luck   from the ongoing lawsuit nobody likes to talk about it though so props on you for asking         have a great weekend   thank you   tether has 300 more injections then 2018 and nobody is talking about it   you should look more into that before the crowd catches on  i believe so as they are not connected with the shady price manipulation scheme and lawsuits   usdc paxos dai are all good tether is pushing the prices up   not billionaires not institutions not some weird rainbow s2f model   the huge lawsuits will eventually

defunct ponzi scheme is up over 206 this year  the growth of an asset doesnt always equal its true value  the majority of investors dont know what theyre buying into they just buy whatever they are

nobody pays me to share my opinions 9 things to quit  1 trying to please everyone 2 fearing change 3 living in the past 4 overthinking 5 being afraid to be different 6 beating yourself up over mistakes 7 sacrificing your happiness for others 8 thinking youre not good enough 9 thinking you have no purpose  nope bitconnect shut down about a month after bitcoin peaked they took everyones bitcoin and then fled  they never caused the btc bubble to burst bitconnect is just a shitty ponzi scheme and has no influence on btc  bitcoin didnt crash because of bitconnect im not sure where you got that from    its very incompetent for any page to tell their followers to buy in up here   i urge you to bookmark or screenshot this tweet and come back to it in the future when bitcoin rejected 20k last time over 240 billion dollars was wiped from the market cap in under 60 days  dont for a second think this run up wont see a similar rejection as we enter very overpriced ranges  it will be very fast brutal and will have no mercy for anyone goldman sachs is predicting a massive upside in 2021  the amount of clueless retail investors that will blindly buy in at or near all time highs all because the trusted banks told them too is going to be amazing    that isnt true if we go beyond 20k which is unlikely we could still crash hard weve literally done it before in 2017  youre like 15 and invest in link and probably havent even graduated high school yet   i am  stay strong there is a bright future for you if you keep focused and work hard i know you can do it   its been a week just wait longer and you will be happy   but you need a strong mind and lots of patience if you dont have that you will lose   i want others to succeed which is why im warning them to buy low and sell high

no one is talking about rightleft here lol   read my pinned post   if youre thinking of buying when its green and up over 400 from 3k in march then you shouldnt be investing   take profits and sit back and wait for the collapse patience  yes  good  yes successful traders develop strategies over years and adapt to changing market conditions as they arise   there is no best strategy staby

from a nonactive wallet because of a headline thats been circulating for many years   it doesnt add up at all but there is still the very slight chances that is the case odd never the less the only way to crack a btc private key is by using a quantum computer   to brute force a private key with todays computing power it would take billions of years or longer   keep that in mind someone just cracked a billion dollar silkroadera bitcoin wallet and moved it during the chaos of election night to avoid public attention   if this was on any other day it wouldve gained nationwide media attention nobody knows who sent the transactions although some are speculating it could be from a hacked wallet   silk road has always been a target of hacks and many large wallets with similar sizes have been circulating amongst hackers  ill update everyone on any updates the nearly 70000 bitcoin was transferred during the action of election night likely to avoid lots of attention      while everyone had their eyes on the us presidential election over 1 billion dollars worth of bitcoin has been quietly moving around   this stands out because the btc was sent from a mysterious silk road

lead in these states   i hope not  you assume all of those votes are bidens   polls said he had a 95 chance of winning and was ahead in every state that wasnt the case   im sure most of those votes will only boost trump  nope i dont suppoeither candidates im calling it for how it is   donald trump won  those are both trumps everyone knows poll who do you think will win tonights election the

 that picture describes it perfectly this is going to be the biggest embarrassment for democrats in political history if donald trump wins again   joe biden was everyones last choice but they carried him through primaries and pushed him to the finals everything comes to you at the right time be patient and trust the process    yep here i explain my thinking   it was more directed to the 90 of

people to avoid buying into alts back in august after recommending them to buy in during the march crash   im sorry you missed those tweets  i think we will drop lower im not saying to buy at these current prices   when btc nukes so will every other altcoin    i think we will be back below 20 cents soon  im not recommending to buy xrp right now im saying accumulate the lower we drop same with btc  im bullish on both for the long term but not before a substantial correction  i dont see a pump for several more months but i will be creating a big document outlining my thoughts theres a lot of things to consider  not to that extent and yes im bearish right now i think we will drop in the shoterm before pumping hard  my targets are realistic and im not an xrp maximalist we arent going to 10k or some other targets ive seen thrown around  username checks out  not yet i think it will drop with btc  i will tweet a lot when i think weve bottomed out fully but dca isnt a terrible idea xrp stayed flat for 4 years prior to its 60000 rally in 2017 those who became impatient and sold early missed on extraordinary gains  weve been moving sideways for 2 years now and im confident we will see a similar pump in the future  accumulate the more we drop   no hate at all just a picture sir   and were we in a global pandemic and flooded in almost 30t in debt during those times no  thanks for

for the elections tomorrow its going to be a big day  research doesnt mean much on a coin thats been around for 2 months and all of the information circulating is created by them   its a scam and i hope you have an exit plan in mind it wont end well  i dont think so sorry  its great  ive heard this about dozens of coins    also you ever question about why their entire brand is we cant rug pull

will be gone within a few months i am certain of it    really a shame i wish they did more this is the latest ponzi ive seen being shilled on dozens of big pages   avoid it at all costs once they get enough investors the devs and insiders will pull the rug and itll become worthless  defi stands for delusional finance  theres been 10000 rug pulls this year and people are still blindly jumping into

2020 and from feb to march tether didnt print anything and look what happened to the prices   the bull rally ended and prices correct 72  bitcoin is being propped up by tether and the moment they decide to stop it will drop like a rock   it was made for a currency crisis   were in a health currency political and economic crisis  similar to how gold performed poorly during the 2008 recession i think btc will as well during the next stock downturn and then be very successful after  anywhere above 10k is overpriced imo  its up because of tether not real demand weve seen this in offchain data and explains why alts arent moving and exchange trades are at lows  hey i would recommend waiting until the hopium turns to fear right now everyone is jumping in blindly  btc will succeed in the long run but not before a big correction far below 10k  i suggest holding off on any buys for at least a few months  usdc and paxos are good stable coins  good bitcoin btc  it never hurts to allocate some of your portfolio into cash especially when were in extremely overpriced ranges   those who have extra capital leftover will be able to buy in cheaper and see higher profits in the long run bitcoin

the name because i dont want to give his page any of the attention he so desperately wants  but the funniest pais after doing 3 minutes of research on who he is i found he runs his own paid group scam and charges up to 200 a month what a clown  i always call out scammers and they get so pressed they  resoto fud campaigns to try to ruin my reputation  i saw 2 pages today say i ran a paid group scam   every person that follows me knows i have no paid content at all ive never accepted a dime from my followers breaking access to more than 10000 login keys allegedly linked to robinhood trading accounts were on the market last week on the dark web       thanks brendan youve probably also seen me call out these scammers hundreds of times which is primarily why they spread false rumors   notice how they provide no proof to these random accusations   because they arent true  whenever bitcoin is green theres always a huge surge in scammers so this is a quick reminder for everyone to be careful   avoid overpriced paid groups crypto funds defi scams online mining shady exchanges and more     never send your funds to anyone  in your opinion what do you think will be a big existential

it wont work this time either if you hate an aspect of your life do something about it no one will change it for you  locking down the entire economy has much worse impacts than the virus     im not saying covid isnt serious im just being logical even who said lockdowns were bad    yes it is you know what lamborghini said about commercials  we dont do commercials because our target audience isnt sitting arou   nope bitcoin hasnt been stable and has dropped in correlation with stocks   i dont think weve seen a decouple yet we will have to see in the coming weeks     if anyone actually falls

a nice sunday   oops youre right and that was an accident it should say cboe instead of cme  oh ya true   thank you means a lot  one of the main reasons why im bearish on bitcoin in the shoterm is because of how manipulated it is   future products have more influence on the price than the spot market   here are some examples of the impact of the introduction of futures in different markets  a

american bitcoin     no there isnt they are all worthless garbage created in 5 minutes by some sketchy russian developer team im sorry  any defi and yield farming shitcoin  basically any page shilling these yield farmingdefi tokens that have been around for like a week   id say roughly 60 of crypto influencers are guilty of it  they all got paid to do so and have insider ties its just a scheme to dump on their followers  no problem i will never be seen shilling a coin i havent done hours and hours of research on and dont own myself every day i get many requests to advertise some scam token for a huge amount of money   ive probably turned down over 100k in the last month i will never be a sell out   be careful though i know many big pages accept that money and are actively shilling these scams crypto exchanges are a thousand times more corrupt than banks paypal is the antithesis of satoshis vision  in 2010 paypal froze wikileaks accounts stole their donations and banned times new

smatraders got in there including myself where i had many calls telling people to buy at 38k  cheers    thanks for sharing your thoughts i like when people do that most of the time when someone disagrees they just throw insults haha   have a great weekend cory  nan  nope   irs be like    no problem at all thank you for all the support  bitcoin also rose on their btc announcement in 2014  right before it crashed 65  great what if i told you bitcoin is up to 7 billion people  bitcoin doesnt need paypal its just another centralized scam trying to profit off it    insanely high fees  no withdrawals  no access to private keys  its basically just a nest for users to speculate on the price then lose money then have it go to paypal  well said and youre absolutely right paypal is the antithesis of satoshis vision  in 2010 paypal froze wikileaks accounts stole their donations and banned julian assange  they are a centralized platform and using them is senseless because it defeats the entire purpose of bitcoin  nope    scammmm  youre that new didnt know cool   3k before 20k is more likely imo  with no clear regulations and dumb money flowing into btc its grossly overvalued   i dont think were ready for another bull market people often compare it to dot com bubble or gold early years but that was totally different   those were fully regulated by gov  i understand your thinking but lets not forget that nobody is taking into consideration government action  everyone just assumes the government will sit here and watch it rise check the charts for what happened when cme futures were implemented into btc dec 18 2017  adoption where because 6 tiny companies said they invested into bitcoin   well thats only to get their stock prices moving up and theres millions of companies that exist   if only this tiny handful have accepted btc in a decade its not that bullish imo    were nearly 40 below all time highs i get it fomo kicks in at these places for many but my tweets are trying to help people not lose money   if we break 20k i will admit i was wrong about my position thank you  you have a nice day too   yep i stand by that were very overvalued up here as is the stock markets its all stimulus no natural demand growth  great   we learn something new each day   that was from jfk almost 60 years ago    the federal reserve is the biggest ponzi scheme in

the charts go watch a movie or read a book  who won the final presidential debate debates2020  exactly how bitcoin transactions will be like on paypal     every single tweet of his is tweetdeck hes probably never been on this website ever lol  finding the exact top is the same as trying to catch a falling knife it could be in or it could go higher but no one knows  for sure but its highly probable the rally doesnt last  lol  i wont have a nice day   i disagree but to each their own    great i appreciate it a lot a wise investor is willing to look the fool for a shotime because they know in the end they will be the ones winning  thanks man  its advisable to take profitsopen shorts lowno lev on the way up rather than trying to get the exact topvery difficult to do that  look at when i posted it and what happened afterwards bitcoin market manipulation  at every top a handful of some of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges temporarily go offline  this ensures that traders cant openclose trades and leaves them exposed to the correction that follows   3rd largest coin in the market and billions have been transferred into bitcoin already  thanks many think its real lol  wow  yeah i said will be like lol its just a glimpse of the future bitcoin isnt on paypal yet and not going to be for a while   i know right exchange owners love it when everyone is blindly jumping in because of emotions its how they make their billions  remem  buy the rumor sell the news  dont buy  yep   i know but it completely defeats the purpose of bitcoin breaking fda approves gileads remdesivir as coronavirus treatment   gild stock surging nearly 4 in after hours   twitter is making it so much worse by trying to censor this story lol  kinda defeats the entire purpose of a decentralized currency how bitcoin transactions will be like on paypal    lol  i already know of them lol  good idea   yep  no worries have a great day  the investigations are fairly new and expected to be completed by the end of this year   also i assume theres many insiders benefiting from it they were largely what caused the 2017 bitcoin bubble   no problem stay safe friend   yes   december probably  of course if that happens i will admit i was wrong about my predictions    but as with everything i tweet nothing is financial advice i always encourage everyone to make their own decisions  hmm i have dozens of tweets talking about the failures of the fed and dollar    hes not wrong though   tether previously claimed to be backed by the us dollar but it was a controversial statement that has since been redacted in light of their scandal  id prefer other pairs just because of the scandal surrounding tether   it isnt much of a hassle to swap over but its advisable in my opinion  data shows that over 85 of traders are long and only a small fraction are shorting  i dont think so the balances were on an uptrend for a decade and we saw the largest expansion    i think we will have to wait another few months to see theres likely an explanation for this  good question as mentioned theres an investigation against them at any moment they can be shut down and it would be catastrophic to the markets   its a guessing game with tether but using their mc changes could be a good indicator definitely keep an eye on it for now   tether is currently involved in a massive fraud and price manipulation investigation   when they become insolvent in the future it will be a big deal theyve been artificially pushing up prices for several years now bitcoins move up likely wasnt caused by the paypal news   it was rather from the billions in tether injections which many permabulls refuse to acknowledge  tether mc has grown by over 300 this year they are essentially cryptos version of the

the fed always acts politically and no president will voluntarily stop printing because it would be disastrous for them printing money was originally meant to bail out massive corporations and get us

centralized and havent outlined any clear plans to be decentralized in their white paper   they built technology that already exists from many other companies   link doesnt offer anything special it rode its wave of hype like i predicted and now is over people are more captivated by coins that have gone up exponentially versus coins that have real utility and value   saying a coin went up 10000 doesnt say anything about if its valuable or not   so many scams have gone up thousands of percent only to drop to zero  thanks mother   spitting straight facts   hope everyone has an amazing weekend

on that and some of your other replies   look at the tweets after that on my timeline i predicted the big crash below 4000 and told people that call was now invalid   im never a perma bull or perma bear i simply trade on events and im no time traveler so i will react like every single person in the world does   that tweet is from march its october ive clearly changed my positions on that after all of the new events that came about  shorting will get you profits without a doubt but make sure to use small leverage if any  many made the mistake of over leveraging during last years dump from 14k to 3k and missed it  if btc remains steady or moves up while stocks plummet that would constitute as a decoupling event   that hasnt happened ever in the last 10 years which is why theyve been very correlated  exactly i think the chances are close to zero but we have to have everything on the table   at this point theres a 99 chance bitcoin will plummet when stocks do  maybe soon  thanks also invalidated would be the scenario that the stock market plunges and bitcoin remains stable or moves up that would change my outlook on things    youre not wrong   same man  ill be writing some

but turbopumpfed raptors have much higher thrust amp propellant mass fraction than pressurefed gas thrusters amp theyre already there   yes falcon 9 will launch  spherex mission  which will collect data on more than 300 million galaxies and explore how the un falcon 9 launches 60 starlink satellites to orbit  mission from pad 39a on deck    its true     yeah by default engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good    yes but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk so landing on 3 engines means high thrustweight further away from hover point which is also risky    yes   it was foolish of us not to sta3 engines amp immediately shut down 1 as 2 are needed to land i am become meme destroyer of shorts  might actually happen sandstorm is a masterpiece  we were too dumb next time we try pull up method  lowkey loki no highs no lows only doge no need to be a gigachad to own dogecoin is the peoples crypto ur welcome   the most entertaining outcome is the most likely doge nan  high seas amp wind this was a tough one  watch falcon 9 launch 60 starlink satellites     off twitter for a while it will be filled with graffiti art  мы сделаем giga berlin progress    neuralink is working super hard to ensure implant safety amp is in close communication with the fda if things go well we might be able to do initial human trials later this year this mission enables access for everyday people who dream of going to space announcing the first commercial astronaut mission to orbit earth aboard dragon    if youve worked on advanced wearables phones or robots those skills are needed  feels weird helping make hopefully good version of cyberpunk come true please consider working at neuralink  shortterm solve brainspine injuries longterm humanai symbiosis   latter will be specieslevel important   work at either at our bay area or austin locations  nan on clubhouse tonight at 10pm la time       tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed o2ch4 before spacex that is not recommended haha launch aleand  are targeting no earlier than april 20 for the launch of the second crew rotation mis       he became a big fan of methane but was not pushing it initially that came from me reading about soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 isp at that isp a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better deltav than a hydrogen stage      that sounds correct tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines dean ono too for kestrel amp draco      tom is great amp was instrumental in developing early versions of merlin amp kestrel but not later versions of merlin or starshipraptor   tw will be 15 so it will accelerate unusually fast high tw is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant the primary cost for expendable rockets throwing away stages is the primary cost so optimization is low tw   no escaping that for me  read the whole article  warm sunny day amp snowy mountains  what a beautiful day in la   yeah dr frankensteen   i never used this guy he gave a talk at spacex once  only halo nan  i sure hope thats not true at tesla or spacex   cryoproof then install engines starship sn9 amp sn10  in retrospect it was inevitable  great shot  live by the sword die by the sword  entropy   buy amp hold companies that make goods amp produce services you love  earth is small amp we are smaller still    with cyberpunk even the hotfixes literally have hotfixes but  great game nan  the dollar is shorting itself  indeed     shopify is great too spacex used them      indeed the economy  making useful products amp providing great services  is what actually matters    tanstaafl would be better to have small fees than no fees as latter makes robinhood beholden to big trading houses got to pay the bills somehow even etsy has fees here come the shorty apologists give them no respect get shorty u cant sell houses u dont own u cant sell cars u dont own but  u can sell stock u dont own this is bs  shorting is a scam legal only for vestigial reasons   yes  finishing engineering this year production starts next year aiming to have release candidate design drivable late summer trimotor drive system amp advanced battery work were important precursors   i made that video   absolutely  unlike its aircraft division which is fine the faa space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure   their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities under those rules humanity will never get to mars  nomad   the esthetics of cyberpunk are incredible btw the interior design is   major esthetics improvements coming   a little  new roadster is parocket    theres more storage now amp easily upgradable    yes   yeah probably in a few months  after you drive without using a prnd stalkstick for a few days it gets very annoying to go back amp use a shifter  no more stalks car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees context amp nav map you can override on touchscreen  a hedge fund that shorts is a shrubbery      yeah also a rear screen 0 to 155mph trap speed in a 14 mile 200mph top speed with right tires first production car ever to achieve 0 to 60 mph in less than 2 seconds it can play cyberpunk plaid model s ships next month  even discord has gone corpo   yup wild times on discord haha nan  waiting for faa review  gamestonk    passed initial pressure test  yes   bought a hand knit wool marvin the martian helm for my dog nan i kinda love etsy  it does not serve the public to hamstring starlink today for an amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation  were hoping for faa approval of a test flight tomorrow afternoon  the entire stack from data collection through labeling amp inference has to be in surround video this is a hard problem critically however this does not require a hardware change to cars in field   yes although it will be crazy not to turn  on fsd  tesla is steadily moving all nns to 8 camera surround video this will enable superhuman selfdriving  some tyranny also the road to hell is mostly paved with bad intentions  catchy      all sats launched next year will have laser links only our polar sats have lasers this year amp are v09     yup    i hope so  these also have laser links between the satellites so no ground stations are needed over the poles   sorry for the version confusion v81 is what it should say for fsd separate version number for rest of car  to my surprise tesla has better ai hardware amp software than waymo money   it floats   falloutthemed opening party for vegas loop happening as soon as allowed    under vegas in  tunnel yesterday with my boys    lasers spacexs rideshare offering provides increased access to space for small satellite operators seeking a reliable affordable rid falcon 9s first stage has landed on the of course i still love you droneship  liftoff     were switching to a more sensible fsd version numbering to distinguish between major amp minor updates current build is fsd 81 it drove me to an unfamiliar location in la amp back last night with no interventions  hopefully early next week due to unfavorable weather we are standing down from todays launch the team will continue with the countdown until t30 seco   given so many other companies are depending on this mission it is getting even more scrutiny than a starlink flight launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers tomorrow excited about offering lowcost access to orbit for small companies   they are paof the solution but require lots of fresh water amp land we may need something thats ultralarge scale industrial in 10 to 20 years for now by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy   sn9   its a good path for fully renewable rocket energy so solves paof problem but longer chain hydrocarbons than ch4 are needed to be solid at room temp details next week am donating 100m towards a prize for best carbon capture technology           pretty much       that would probably mean civilization is doing great although depends on assumptions for inflation haha           hes everywhere    absolutely they rock  falcon 9 launches starlink to orbit  the eighth launch and landing of this booster   the ratelimiting paor process in cell production is constantly changing   cars amp trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases amp particulate but  road tunnels under miami would solve traffic amp be an example to the world   spoke with  about tunnels last week if governor amp mayor want this done we will do it    with our giant casting machines we are literally trying to make fullsize cars in the same way that toy cars are made   tegmark is an exceptionally smaamp good human  the best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume industries like food amp beverage some medical eg syringes amp toys battery cell production is the fundamental ratelimiter slowing down a sustainable energy future very important problem   looking into this no question that fsd should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a tradein   for sure  glad youre ok  congratulations  this is a good one  i whistle    cybertruck doesnt need a garage   it will be awesome  good point  your serverside code is doing too much  happy birthday wikipedia so glad you exist  guess you been watching cobra kai   fallout new texas   only chuck norris can divide by zero    good point   the thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation   what actually matters is making goods amp providing services   we should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint   whichever has least error amp latency will win monty python is amazing     they sure can twist the knife in that show   probably wise  were making major improvements to ease of engine swap needs to be a few hours at most    two of the engines need slight repairs so will be switched out   nice shot  we dont have high school internships but please apply when youre in college  prototypes are easy volume production is hard positive cash flow is  excruciating  physics splashdown of dragon confirmed completing spacexs 21st  resupply mission and the first return of a cargo resupp  detanking amp inspections now good progress towards our hop in amp go to mars goal all three static fires completed amp no ruds    wow a lot has happened in 10 years  fair enough haha nan  sea shanty tiktok takes it to a new level with actual pirate ships  sure today at spacex is about practicing starship engine starts ship is held down by massive pins while engines are fired two starts completed about to try a third  as promised legalize comedy  you can steal our namelogos amp we probably wont sue you   were just trying to get people to mars help would be appreciated   one day we will get a camera up there that also shows the star field in the background separation confirmed dragon performing 3 departure burns to move away from the    suicide is more than double homicide   absolutely hey you  yeah you queen  youre gonna make it      hate to say it but might be true  the robot future is coming   300km every millisecond but there are times i wish it were faster     mus protec  yoda   он был великолепен   this is an important distinction  much more than this amp increasing rapidly   it is  once in a while something happens that is even better than we imagined  the factory is the product   probably commenting on  will do more  i bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for 20 theyre great places to get spare parts  a lot of people are going to be super unhappy with west coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech   already donated to signal a year ago will donate more  i am primarily trying to advance two causes sustainable energy amp extending lifeconsciousness beyond earth there is also the existential threat of ai which we should aspire to mitigate this doesnt leave time to write books       maybe a tesla ai day later this year  the prancing pony      its true   yes but not for long  yeah they seemed optimistic too my 14yearold son saxon said he feels like 2021 will be a good year i agree let us all make it so   was also thinking that spacex boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time   i super suppopublic spaces around our production amp launch sites wherever it can be done safely and securely when covid passes we will open up our restaurant to the public amp figure out ways to allow limited access to the high bar     that too    catapult high into the air amp land on the roof with a base jumping parachute the only way to travel   thats actually our restaurant but spacex is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows amp a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory  and increase fun hopefully  me neither   one of the best tesla solar roof installations  no but maybe one day   yes that would be the best way to do it a large solar field or reactor is needed for power and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the h2o these are probably the trickier bits  his sick beats   probably less than a few dozen primary decisionmakers technically only three   or at least the option for verification so that the public can ascribe more credibility to verified vs unverified accounts launch underway  btw critical feedback is always super appreciated as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference way harder than it seems   yup  indirectly an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to conveco2h2o gt ch4o2 this will be needed on mars even for early missions amp earth too over time  not to get to orbit unfortunately in space photon emission powered by matterantimatter annihilation would rock but thats more of a longterm solution   this will be hard to make as it isnt like any other vehicle  playing the long game  true  i hope so wings dont work on the moon at all and def not well on mars also no runways  hamiltonians have 2v the potential of langrangians and a play nan  well back to work   how strange use signal  ya dont say reminds me of this timeless classic    fast water with tiny rocks  yes and then occams razor is actually third most likely as seen from an external observer not the participants the most entertaining outcome is the most likely  dumb and dumber is a great movie tho this is called the domino effect           doesnt quite illustrate true size difference starship payload volume amp mass are gt1000 that of shuttle because of the large footprint it may seem flat but actually ranges up to 5 stories tall snow falling on giga berlin    yes    tesla is responsible for 23 of all the personal amp professional pain in my life combined but it was worth it so proud of the tesla team for achieving this major milestone at the staof tesla i thought we had optimistically a 10 chance of surviving at all  in 2020 we produced and delivered half a million cars huge thanks to all those who made this possible   um we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance  tesla full selfdriving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year of that i am confident cant speak for regulators though  dojo isnt needed but will make selfdriving better it isnt enough to be safer than human drivers autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers ignore the heading great interview with mathias döpfner    the greatest gatsby   inspired by the ballet   rocket motion is primarily vertical so you want the top open  lets make the roaring 20s again  might be a few lumps along the way    production is hard prototypes are easy building 1000 starships to create a selfsustaining city on mars is our mission      exactly  haha    sn9 will press ch4 header tank with helium longterm solution is under debate not clear what is lightestsimplest     yes    legs would certainly work but best pais no pabest step is no step   yes   saves mass amp cost of legs amp enables immediate repositioning of booster on to launch mount  ready to refly in under an hour  were going to try to catch the super heavy booster with the launch tower arm using the grid fins to take the load snakehead dog had my undivided attention until winderhead ostrich came gliding through all nonchalant   seems odd that the opposition group is from bmws home state of baveria thats very far from brandenburg where tesla is building the gigafactory   and why would a group that claims to be proenvironment oppose a sustainable energy factory arent there more important issues  this is very sensible opposition from anywhere cannot mean no progress everywhere  literally  are we sure this is real destiny destiny no escaping  that for me all tesla cars delivered in the final three days of the year will get three months of the full selfdriving option for free delivery amp docs must be fully complete by midnight dec 31st  and mark dankberg this action is wack not dank  less  westworld the last kingdom show is great  absolutely will be text amp visualization but could add voice too   even cheese is made of cake   if they dont love us were in deep trouble not everything is made of cake   true haha such a weird game when you think about it  this is not cgi   we need a ui overhaul    no these are just incremental improvements to the production codebase fsd build is a fundamental rewrite not just in the car but also our video traininglabeling software  starlink poses a hazard to viasats profits more like it stop the sneaky moves charlie ergen entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves  just meeting with larry ellison to seek some advice back working on tesla end of quarter tomorrow  absolutely what should tesla do with incar gaming in an autonomous world   absolutely  taste of the future try playing polytopia in your tesla great game multiplayer online version coming soon  focus on making products amp services people truly love so that the total economic pie is bigger instead of engaging in zerosumnegativesum corporate power struggles this is the good future     roughly 95 of parts in tesla roadster were unique  not in any other product unfortunately since we started out with the dumb in retrospect goal of simply adapting lotus elise to electric we ended up with a 10 too small sports car that seems kinda like a lotus   yes  very important   ok service might be able to do this will check   you mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that dont have it   no but definitely this year  good point    interesting  liz has always done great interviews   falcon was 25 of successful orbital launches in 2020 but maybe a majority of payload to orbit anyone done the math  vaccines are just the staits also capable in theory of curing almost anything turns medicine into a software amp simulation problem       yes      we will offer multiple display options    a few more revisions needed probably beta 10 or 11   sure   haha ok    there are subtle important differences between us amp canada traffic rules but fsd beta will be extended to canada very soon   yes  we need a match other traffic speed setting  definitely   its a step in that direction  its one  or 12  if you dont have a car with pedestrian speaker we couldnt get everything done in time but more stuff coming  the writing on cobra kai is sick  haha i will save you the nightmare of seeing me in those shorts  you can upload custom musicsounds  unfortunately pedestrian speaker is needed otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn change your horn sound to    or holiday jingles with latest tesla software update merry christmas amp happy holidays    great game   it will most likely make sense for starlink to go public once the revenue growth is reasonably predictable  engineering design amp general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind amp are the fundamental limitation on doing more   capital allocation is important but low cpu load tesla public company duties are a much bigger factor but going private is impossible now sigh    yes   a few months  coming soon  minor  yeah 12 story rocket turns off its engines amp does a controlled fall   yup were just ironing out a few bugs to tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year your suppois super appreciated   frictionless ai what could possibly go wrong  good idea  during the darkest days of the model 3 program i reached out to tim cook to discuss the possibility of apple acquiring tesla for 110 of our current value he refused to take the meeting  strange if true    tesla already uses ironphosphate for medium range cars made in our shanghai factory   a monocell is electrochemically impossible as max voltage is 100x too low maybe they meant cells bonded together like our structural battery pack  spartas reply to macedon     hi liz thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make tesla successful my heagoes out to you  indeed  it was a seriously twisted affair but alls that ends well  they are although its kind lowkey tesla superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars photos from yesterdays launch and landing     are such large transactions even possible  i love all u crazy ppl out there   you have a point sigh  great game  pretty much the main value of college used to be hanging out having pseudo intellectual conversations amp partying with people your own age now even thats gone come for the comments  stay for the memes  absolutely we will release fsd subscription early next year one word doge bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money  great nails amp lipstick           nice nan  sounds about right lord edge   nice branding just kidding who needs a safe word anyway bitcoin is my safe word falcon 9s first stage has landed on landing zone 1  liftoff   standing down for today to inspect rocket hopefully launching tomorrow  pressure is slightly high in upper stage liquid oxygen tank review underway  i am hoping to be back next month  very impressive mission by china  last launch of 2020 coming up    he was indeed quite grumpy but we did not actually know what we were doing so he had a point  it will get absurdly good tesla aiautopilot engineering is awesome theres some great ai out there but can it selfdrive while playing cyberpunk   star light star bright    this is incorrect    but it is visually stunning amp playability is good  a tshibeing better armor than a kevlar chest plate doesnt make sense in the absence of magic also wish there werent levelbased item limits in a singleplayer game  oh and umm    i absolutely suppotrans but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare   the raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit as we hit min throttle point an engine would shut off   far from fully loaded but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy highfar with three engines   its a good to great game imo but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great   perhaps slightly more confident but its essential to view this as output vs time as with all manufacturing especially new technology output will follow an scurve very slow at first but increasing exponentially then linear then logarithmic  dankeschön brandenburg und grünheide   sure hope that future doesnt come to pass  giga berlinbrandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture 4680 worlds most advanced cells made onsite both front amp rear body castings amp advanced paint shop warning with so much new technology production timing is naturally harder to predict   original deus ex was incredible human revolution was also great  the objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware this is a much more serious issue  starship landing flip maneuver    ascent to the heavens      yeah briefly seems pretty good i picked nomad so stawas a little slow but picks up fast seemed like almost everyone on steam was playing cyberpunk at some point this weekend     hehe      nan nan falcon 9 launches sxm7 to orbit completing spacexs 25th launch this year   init void    cooling haha    i still have a soft spot in my heafor transpiration cooking in theory it would use more mass than a tile heatshield but that remains to be seen   ship leeward side will be bare metal windward will have black hexagonal heat shield tiles cant wait  spacex spacexstarship    yes   agreed should be preserved in memory of sn8 photos from starship sn8s flight test      exactly woohoo   sn8 did great even reaching apogee wouldve been great so controlling all way to putting the crater in the right spot was epic thank you south texas for your suppothis is the gateway to mars life the universe and everything   yeah engines did great mars here we come fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn causing touchdown velocity to be high amp rud but we got all the data we needed congrats spacex team hell yeah successful ascent switchover to header tanks amp precise flap control to landing point     nearorbital space is the fastest way to travel long distance on earth   its called the space station but its actually moving around earth at 25 times the speed of sound or 10 times faster than a rifle bullet timelapse of dragon on approach  two dragons now docked to the   so long and thanks for the orifice  alien message decrypted  probably 13 chance of completing all mission objectives  hopefully flying tomorrow  yup success at 140pm et  upgraded dragon cargo spacecraft autonomously docked to the     this is the 1st out on the pad in south texas  the station and the  dragon are going into an orbital night period before the 130pm et docking the crewdragon   wow station looks amazing good morning earthlings  the journey continues   watch as the nasa  cargo resupply mission docks to the   knock knock singing telegram  carrying even more symbiotic bacteria 40 trillion than cells   yes  we are mobile cell colonies 100 tracking footage from a helicopter of todays falcon 9 launch off lc39a  theres something genuinely magical about seeing starship sn8 in person boca chica is beautiful quiet and serine t im gespräch mit mathias döpfner    dragon separation confirmed the spacecraft is on its way to the  autonomous docking tomorrow at approximately 1 falcon 9 booster has landed on the of course i still love you droneship  liftoff    congratulations  congratulations    yes it does tunnel rave   and no toilet paper  watch demolition man prometheus unbound the falcon 9 booster supporting this mission previously launched  astronauts bob behnken and doug hurley to the        not bad  it was a beast compared to the vic20  award accepted on behalf of the great people at tesla spacex neuralink amp boring co much of what people think of an science is actually engineering eg no such thing as a rocket scientist only rocket engineers latter is who put humans on the moon science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the universe engineering is about creating things that never existed   it does get a bit cold at night  paint makes a hell of a difference  congrats  thanks for everything you did to help build spacex some of the best memories ever  it will be real soon     starship legs are one of the hardest problems externally mounted legs require shielding which adds mass wider stance adds mass shock absorbers add mass that said we need better legs    static fire is not risky from build site but we need to clear the build site for early flights   just a static fire tomorrow flight no earlier than wednesday   it will have landing legs    yes very sad news tony was great   for a second there i thought that was a pic of thanos haha   yeah truncate zeros amp then round   probably going to a wider beta in 2 weeks  fp16 with least important digits truncated so it feels like fp32 is what were betting on for training with dojo  int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great  but actually    happy thanksgiving       hopefully next month      ok overall air suspension height amp damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention will be linked to fsd so acts automatically  haha true  the promise is greatly needed  we will have special colors for new roadster as we did for the original     is savage   if you ever wondered where we came from this is a life leader launch so more risk than normal     yes but only slightly filled    this is a subject of much debate   major upgrades are slated for sn15   many small improvements but overall similar wiring is more robust engines are more mature nosecone is sealed better etc  but thats why we have sn 9 amp sn10  lot of things need to go right so maybe 13 chance good starship sn8 static fire aiming for first 15km  50k ft altitude flight next week goals are to test 3 engine ascent body flaps transition from main to header tanks amp landing flip   maybe staon that a year from now depends on how starship progress goes   not yet   not bad we will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant but its probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull  rapid amp complete rocket reuse low cost propellant orbital refilling amp propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary     yes    were still far from simply video in control out the biggest gamechanger currently underway at tesla is 360 degree high fps video for labeling training amp inference   fsd beta 5 coming out in a few days improvement should be significant  exciting mission   wow  yea tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket landing on droneship of course i still love you    sure   true    we have quiet a queue of products to build better do new roadster at some point   fate loves irony but hates hypocrisy booster separation secondengine staand fairing separation as the useuropean sentinel6 michael freilich oceanobserving   yes   our data center was named skynet as a joke over 10 years ago might have been tempting fate   tesla is a vehicle for creating amp producing many useful products  largest cast titanium pain the world no heat shielding needed landing at vandenberg afb in california        actually off to the side so it doesnt take out the launch mount in bad landing but with the same arm used to pick up the ship       where it should be   because i am not an investor tesla is definitely not the only good company but investing is not what i do but i always put my own money into companies i help create otherwise itd be wrong to ask others to do so well almost anything  quite the day ahead  crew1s view of earth during dragons flight to the     now this is what youd call pointy  cool     theyre moving at 25 times the speed of sound but it feels like nothing         there will always be upgrades      it will be better than human vision by quite a margin     reality looks like a strange ghostworld at radar wavelengths almost everything except metal is translucent     exactly   this is a misperception spacex developed amp continues to use lidar for dragon docking with    just pointless imo for selfdriving if youre going to do active photon generation use an occlusion penetrating wavelength like precision radar at 4mm   one day we will fly you on starship  well done   i cant comment on turbopump internal details but youre roughly in the ballpark wow rocket turbopumps especially if oxygenrich are insanely hard arguably the hardest mechanicalfluidscombustion problem known to exist  to be clear this was just an xpeng problem other companies in china have not done this    andrej is awesome but it should be said that we have a very talented autopilotai team at tesla too much credit comes to me amp andrej   yeah they stole apples code too   they have an old version of our software amp dont have our nn inference computer  wild times  congrats    yup  change out a few parts otherwise fine  caution strongly advised with spacs    sure   haha sexy cropping champion of all time   if next weeks release looks good we will widen beta   unfortunately there are too many rules around liquor distribution even in the us however we will be selling the lightning bottle amp shot glasses worldwide  next weeks release is special lot of fundamental improvements both important bug fixes amp entire new areas of functionality   13 years amp 11 billion  wow    safety is our primary design goal    fully  let the martians decide their own future   a lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units  terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime however we can establish a human base there in our lifetime at least a future spacefaring civilization  discovering our ruins  will be impressed humans got that far    that is certainly the intention     the only publicly traded stock i own is tesla  wise words from bogle the point of companies is products amp services they have no point in amp of themselves nor do these indices buy amp hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap sell where you dont     no just a mild cold same with my bro def had cov2 though pclt20 means viral load of gt10 million per ml  life in glass domes at first eventually terraformed to suppolife like earth   yeah   i was going to say sim but that seemed too obvious haha  deveras  and cases with high noninfectious ct should quarantine for a few days while getting another test second test determines whether theyre just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards where viral fragments exist but person is not infectious  so many things you want amp some you didnt know you wanted  maybe a little mercy   tesla holiday software release is     cobra kai is a deep cut  its all cake amp someone took a bite  there is such a thing as too much sentience deus ex machine learning   its designed to make life multiplanetary otherwise extreme overkill for mere earth sector activity   starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current earth rockets combined including falcon necessary for a city on mars   more like he gave it his blessing it was soof a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in london nullius in verba   indeed    dojodoge    yeah looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than 1m for more than 100 tons to orbit so its mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year    exactly   merlin is a strong local maximum design but kerosene is suboptimal fuel no matter what you do   what matters is cost per ton to mars ch4 is the only choice imo important o2ch4 allows of ratio of 35 vs 25 for kerosene so 78 of propellant is oxygen      yes but from a visiting american ah the irony is just too much     yeah pcr ct was unequivocal at lt20 doesnt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold    maybe making some notable changes will wait until figurative amp literal dust settles    pretty close definitely feel  if i take dayquil frankly this was one of the mildest coldflu experiences ive ever had   avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields amp adding watercooled steel pipes to test pad   about 2 secs after starting engines martyte covering concrete below shattered sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay one rock blade severed avionics cable causing bad shutdown of raptor   the most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they sometimes dont blow up the amount of power going through them boggles the mind  we should just count the atoms at this point     absolutely productiontesting of rocket engines is over 90 of the problem this is true in general for cars production is over 99 of the problem that 1 inspiration is very important but its less than 1 of the pain    our first merlin engine design was really bad tbh nothing worked well amp some parts didnt work at all 18 years later amp thousands of upgrades make it a great gg cycle engine     maybe i just love irony haha     theyre on their way hopefully more teslaquila next month  special permission received from stonecutters guild     fate  irony  well said         damn thats not easy i spent quite a bit of time looking at russianukrainian engines theyre good   yes docking confirmed  crew dragon has arrived at the    toss a bitcoin to ur witcher    enter the crew dragon at 448 pm est 948 pm utc the nasa  crew1 astronauts give you a live tour of their space   curevac moderna amp a few others tesla makes the machine curevac uses to go from known gene sequence to trillions of lipidcoated mrna strands  creating synthetic mrna for curesvaccines is the future of medicine imo turns it mostly into a software amp modeling problem     haha  great thread  im ok thanks for asking no symptoms for past few days apafrom fatigue unless something changes would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold nan launch in 5 minutes  yeah with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls the same propellant is used either for aboor for orbital maneuvering as one use obviates the other dragon can also hover amp land propulsively but we use the parachutes for maximum safety  thrusters are integrated with spacecraft enabling abocapability all the way to abofor increased safety  what song would you play on your ride out to the launch pad launchamerica  dragon has completed 22 flights to and from the  it was designed from the beginning with human spaceflight in mi dragon is the only spacecraft currently flying capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to earth and is the first priv spacexs customtailored suits route the communications and cooling systems and protect the crew in the event of cabin depressu live now we are ready to launchamerica are you   watch coverage of the nasa  crew1 mission liftoff is at 727pm et watch falcon 9 launch crew dragon on its first operational mission to the  with astronauts on board    ok all systems are go for tonights launch at 727 pm est of crew dragons first operational mission with four astronauts on boa     yeah i feel pretty normal no symptoms right now last week i had symptoms of a minor cold ive had some brutal flucold experiences but this was mild amp hopefully over    doing tests from several different labs same time of day administered by rn amp am requesting n1 gene pcr cycle threshold there is no official standard for pcr testing not sure people realize this   both obv insanely great too bad they had this pointless argument astronaut launch today  has a message for boys and girls in japan space is waiting   in this  spotlight  astronaut so this week   nasas  crew1 astronauts arrive at  ahead of launch  our  rover marks 100 days spacex nasa crew1 just finished final dress rehearsal getting ready for saturday launch behind me is real dragon  no kids though  hell of a wig collection too  it would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results great question its more complex question and depends on why the test is being used  ie do you want to kn worth reading this thread if youre curious about rona testing    they should be imo if you get a blood pressure test they tell you the number not just if its highnothigh there is not a clear consensus on what ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes positive   a little up amp down feels just like a regular cold but more body achy amp cloudy head than coughingsneezing dayquil rocks  in your opinion at what ct number for the cov2 n1 gene should a pcr test probably be regarded as positive if im asking the wrong question what is a better question     cool but please be super cautious expect two steps forward one back lot of new code was merged  just a scratch we can buff it out  am getting wildly different results from different labs but most likely i have a moderate case of covid my symptoms are that of a minor cold which is no surprise since a coronavirus is a type of cold   npcs all the way up  ahem unless youre on dmt laws of thermodynamics 1 you cant win 2 you cant break even 3 you cant stop playing shakes fist at entropy  big expansion of beta program in 6 to 8 weeks   interesting my thursday night saliva sample came back today with n1 gene unique to cov2 showing at cycle 26 amp n3 generic sars at 24 i get results of todays test tomorrow almost no symptoms today so hopefully better results   whats honey  feels that way    this seems accurate   cold symptoms are gone for now   there are degrees of pos     heneghan makes a lot of sense hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the center for evidencebased medicine at oxford  general public doesnt realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft  the number of pcr amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load from what i can gather youre probably not infectious above 30 amp you probably are below 25 sound about right    this a great reference worth a read case closed  soon   fwiw lab i just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate 30 to 40 gets dicey amp above 40 is bs will talk to several more labs there must be a graph of pcr amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere lab i just spoke to said cov2 pcr detection n1 amp n3 genes below 30 cycles is reliable amp above 40 cycles is not   note this is not the spike protein they dont consider that reliable   just spoke directly to a testing lab their main pcr search is for the n1 gene unique to cov2 n3 is also sought but is generic to other sars viruses high pcr cycle count does give false positives but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles amp 40 cycles is their max  strange  possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold amp flu prevalence vs prior years if someone comes in with coldflu symptoms amp falsely tests positive for cov2 they will assume they have it when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal coldflu  moreover lower the true prevalence the higher the false positive number will be this sounds obvious but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low  from    sure is would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the pcr testing industry whats the approximate false positive rate all things considered for cov2 pcr tests  interesting   interesting what is the general population no knowledge of symptoms accuracy of a sarscov2 pcr test amp is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles   a good pcr test should identify if i have the cov2 spike proteins although i have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too hard to get a straight answer   false positives will roughly scale with  of tests amp daily test rate has gone ballistic    mild sniffles amp cough amp slight fever past few days right now no symptoms although i did take nyquil  technically i tested positive then negative twice then positive again so elon musk tests negative for covid is an equally correct title the rapid antigen test from bd seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin the carousel turns ever faster   yup  exactly  symptoms of a typical cold nothing unusual so far  if its happening to me its happening to others im getting pcr tests from separate labs results will take about 24 hours something extremely bogus is going on was tested for covid four times today two tests came back negative two came back positive same machine same test same nurse rapid antigen test from bd  burst disk worked so vehicle appears to be ok well have to swap out at least one of the engines    maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold whatever it is caused pneumatics loss we need to design out this problem  we lost vehicle pneumatics reason unknown at present liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure otherwise its going to pop the cork   tesla tops list of 2020s most attractive employers for us engineering students  4 astronauts fly to  on sat night from cape first operational flight of crew dragon   luck is the best superpower thank you to all those who have served and sacrificed veteransday  crew access arm swings into place   yes  it is an honor that they would choose to work with me i strive to ensure that the companies enable creative amp driven people to reach their potential such a privilege to work with people i like amp respect so much i feel blessed the flight readiness review for the crew1 mission to the  has concluded and  and  are go t falcon 9 and crew dragon vertical on launch complex 39a            probably   happy to see this    i do expect this to become an important product for the world but probably not financially material for tesla         theres no entrybraking burn amp hypersonic angle of attack is 70 degrees   tesla makes the rna bioreactor that can make vaccines  cures curevac has version 2 in use version 3 is under development crew dragon and falcon 9 in the hangar at launch complex 39a ahead of launching four astronauts to the  liftoff  checking  i just hope this game doesnt twist itself to tedium out of fear of being canceled rumor has it that austin chalk is geologically one of best soils for tunneling want to find out austin jobs now avai nan yes you can have my damn cookie should be a browser setting   thanks to a lot of great autopilotai hardware amp software engineers at tesla  for sure   will be worth it  exactly   sure  actually its still there     wait until you see what cybertruck will do  this is accidental will be back shortly 20k superchargers and counting     am hoping to change booster design to land back on launch mount with no legs will require extreme precision   chip has temp sensor amp automatically maintains safe temp    enough already on my plate amp teslas maybe one day will do a prototype those are relatively easy volume production with high reliability amp low cost amp passing all regulations is 100x harder  neuralink wont overclock the brain it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain this is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer but a neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input amp output especially latter    we rewrote all labeling software for 4d very different from labeling single photos dojo wont contribute for about a year its mostly a generalized nn training computer but benchmark were tracking is framessecond must beat next gen gputpu clusters or its pointless   version 1 is about a year away   it would appear that their calculations were incorrect  china understands the profound importance of reusability the era of expendable rockets will soon be over   tesla autopilotai team   good explanation 4d is essential for dynamically occluded objects especially in large intersections with dense vehicle amp pedestrian traffic frame rate amp latency from frame to wheel vector change also important  the phantom of the opera  is here  inside your mind       just looking for problemsolvers who get things done with a high sense of urgency dont care if or where they went to school when sending your resume please describe a few of the hardest problems you solved amp exactly how you solved them a new banner is needed neither hard left nor right  another fine day in the simulation   faraday invented the electric motor tesla the commutatorfree threephase ac induction motor in other words a useful electric motor  maxwell was amazing should have more recognition tesla motors inc was almost called faraday as it took until late 20042005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since 1995 420 is ten times better than 42 nan deployment of gps iii4 confirmed  falcon 9s first stage lands on the of course i still love you droneship  liftoff     awaiting approval from canadian authorities recruiting ace engineers for giga berlin will interview in person tomorrow on site send resume to 25guns    stop being a chad    uh  chad wtf  einstein was great but did not succeed at engineering and he tried  yeah that will be relatively easy as so few users out in the ocean     yes although i didnt expect the stock to rise so much so soon the reason for the stock options is that theyre needed to help pay for humanity to get to mars in 10 to 20 years   super appreciate your supposteve that convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway fortunately daimler invested 50m in may 2009 5 months later    closest we got was about a month the model 3 ramp was extreme stress amp pain for a long time  from mid 2017 to mid 2019 production amp logistics hell   i put in my last money even though i thought we would still fail but it was either that or certain death for tesla extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup considered super quirky back then while stalwarts like gm amp chrysler were going bankrupt  that funding round completed 6pm on christmas eve in 2008 last hour of last day possible as investors were leaving town that night amp we were 3 days away from bankruptcy i put in all money i had didnt own a house amp had to borrow money from friends to pay rent difficult time   yes  lowering starlink terminal cost which may sound rather pedestrian is actually our most difficult technical challenge  as soon as we get regulatory approval hopefully around middle of next year  right now it takes about 5 mins to set up but with future improvements probably less than 3 mins no technical knowledge needed just point at open sky amp plug in   canada and norway are next after we get us out of early beta   didnt realize that was possible no problem if theres a way get current design cybertruck approved in europe  as soon as we get country approval this is required for each country individually as no euwide approval system exists probably stareceiving final there are many steps approvals around febmarch  lower latitude states need more satellites in position so probably january several thousand more starlink beta participation invitations going out this week  new design is better with many minor tweaks even the small details matter  haha very close to actual expected flight   i could not be more excited about the new supercollider that said while it is considerably larger i dont think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering           sure maybe in a month or so          well its basically a tank from the future thats roadlegal so yeah         tesla texas team is making great progress giga texas factory will be an asskicker  yes penguin random house  should change the name to random penguin  sure although it might be quite a sholivestream lot can go wrong but well provide video warts amp all you will see every frame that we do   this is what matters most    weve tested a subscale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability so it will probably work at scale but reality tends to bite you on the ass     lord of the      yeah although if it fails right at the end some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater    minor    understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch yaw amp roll during descent such that the ship is positioned well to relight flip amp land would be a big win   but a rud right off launch pad is also possible fortunately sn9 is almost ready   stable controlled descent with body flaps would be great transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks amp relight would be a major win    every 5 to 10 days    faults will never be zero but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human   we measure this primarily in intervention probability this update addressed several issues resulting in perhaps 13 fewer interventions many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments true for most beta releases in my experience  thanks to a great autopilotai team working super hard   doing neural nets without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what theyre doing reality is the hardest sim  latency will improve significantly soon bandwidth too  this build should be noticeably better with interventions    yes   ive spent more than half my life in california amp love the state but frankly i think ca has the winningfortoolong problem   like a sports team with many championships it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency amp a sense of entitlement  and  sweden is still right with zero deaths oct 29   true also fewer heaattacks as way easier to pump blood in 37 gravity    now were talking also stephenson 218 is in the constellation scrotum haha  small fry the sun converts over 4 million tons of mass to energy every second  accurate       some challenges with high winds looks like sunday for static fire  great shot   future ai will appreciate this  truth is stranger than fiction    urf is so smōl  for a long time truth be told ive eaten at jitb many times over the years even the teriyaki bowl might buy a jack in the box footstool  approximately lograte  same bot just change setting to combat  well being a phased array antenna it is actually rather flat tesla should make  catgirl robots  little crane am i just a toy to you   come here  no come here  wow this mayo sure is salty   max payne was great on many levels silent hill good too jack in the box should do double duty as a sperm donor clinic  name is    one of the best games ever   fear 1 with modern graphics amp sound would rock   ok    all games in this thread are far scarier amp more creatively so than any horror movie  fear 2 is best imo also dead space 2 they will haunt your dreams     to the best of my knowledge literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades   most of the factory had no equipment at all even light bulbs were missing in some areas  gm amp toyota took everything that worked amp moved it to their other factories  all that was left were broken bots amp equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value but we scrounged up spare parts fixed the trusty old bots amp brought the factory back to life  and there were actually zero employees in the factory after gmtoyota left they took all good equipment amp sold most of rest for scrap it looked apocalyptic inside  bettern nothin or ur  back     tesla team has done great work  well tbh our capex efficiency in 2017 was trash   testing for covid is a license to print money   yes very helpful thanks all beta testers  video training amp inference is essential for excellent autonomy  sigh  there should be a new supersonic jet this time electric  critical to humanitys future congratulations spacex team   mine is a few days ahead   sure it could be an option in settings  visualization will tone down significantly for production these are intentionally strident colors     sure     im in boca every week so maybe we could talk then given that starship is not exactly subtle this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see    good point probably next week in form of a written piece on spacex website   great pics that we now have the beginnings of a starship production system is most meaningful  yup with beta updates therell be a lot of 2 steps fwd 1 step back situations but pace of improvement will be extremely fast  working on it also needs to be able faat other cars on command  starship is coming together price change is pushed to thursday next week applies only to us for now one week clock will stain other countries as beta is released fsd monthly rental will also be available sometime next year  there will be a 360 deg glass star bar name tbd at top of high bay  well we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves how much time do you think we should give  agreed are these performance tires  just a smallseeming issue with loss of upper stage camera probably nothing serious but standing down to reexamine whole vehicle just in case  sure now that tesla fsd beta is out in limited release fsd price new or upgrade will go up by 2k on monday     as soon as we complete testing amp regulators approve so many different traffic signs rules amp languages around world not to mention driving on left side of road also a long amp challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9s reliability way beyond human    yes   haha  dependent on proving high safety  not intentional we just wanted to show that you could theoretically convethe entire us vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in nevada a single state tesla will do lithium mining only as needed we also found a way to extract lithium using nacl table salt  cold gas for now hot later  i mean ya gotta have a tiki bar  starship nosecone high bay amp tiki bar     after it gets to orbit a few times  got a little melty tbh   those engines could go 300 bar but would be dicey pushing it for nearterm tests doesnt achieve anything but im confident raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights  raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues 210 mtf sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes   rboost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area will need bigger pumps fsd beta rollout happening tonight will be extremely slow amp cautious as it should data from 3 engine starship static fire this morning looks good proceeding with nosecone mate   yes we also have to consider population lifemonths lost from lockdowns amp other restrictions vs lifemonths lost from any given disease  sweden at zero deaths oct 15   yes   firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description but yes theres no place like homeespecially if it has a solar roof  this kansas ranch got theirs installed in 4 days    mobic has too much mobility fusion has too little we need mobid haha   actually its my neck     maybe i can be helpful had mobic disc put in at c5c6 however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord 2nd surgery took care of it recommend using yelp or other online reviews of doctors effectiveness varies widely  pretty accurate its not so much dna sequencing as it is using synthetic dnarna to fix bugs in our code amp inform immune system what to attack  london to beijing would be cool  wow that would be quite a trip  thats my kid haha møtør trèndé   looks like snoopy  current production is slightly better   doesnt seem to be any life in this solar system maybe under the ice of europa or extremophile bacteria below the surface of mars worth reading  tesla model 3 sr has lowest energy consumption of all bevs says repo  very creative  that free fusion reactor in the sky conveniently converts 4 million tons of mass into energy every second we just need to catch an extremely tiny amount of it to power all of civilization   you never know  after     also system should autodelete old data automatically by default  table in tension  yes  starting production on 7 seater next month initial deliveries early december the gauntlet has been thrown down   the prophecy will be fulfilled   model s price changes to 69420 tonight          more great renderings significant improvements coming to the welds   congratulations  making progress 9 meter or roughly 30 ft diameter will be less roomy with 3 vacuum rocket engines added       its still there but focus is vegas amp prufrock our new tunneling machine     for sure     maybe a month or so some finishing touches need to be done on the stations    we simplified this a lot its basically just teslas in tunnels at this point which is way more profound than it sounds  sweet   yes everything is slow to a phased array antenna  nice what is love baby dont hume winston churchill   or maybe 2 weak turrets to allow more strategic degrees of freedom   please buff torbs turret  um  yes  i have goosebumps 2 merch not sure how tbh  hg2g  lotr  the illuminaughty           knee deep this will be the first flight of the upgraded cargo version of dragon which is able to carry 50 more science payloads than th the dragon spacecraft supporting spacexs 21st cargo resupply mission to the  departed our hawthorne factory last  yeah  at least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time   diess is doing his best to move in the right direction but hes in a tough position with so many constituencies to please no way to make everyone happy  good grief spacex is getting zero money for this starship is designed to carry people amp cargo around earth also to moon amp mars vast majority of use will be civilian its just like an airline in space all airlines sometimes carry military cargo but 99 is civilian  with fsd we got stuck in a lot of local maximums which wasnt clear until we hit the ceiling this time its right   thank you much more accurate haha  this graph appears to be upside down  sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate almost every element of production is gt75 automated only wire harnesses amp general assembly which are lt10 of production costs are primarily manual   will release order configurator probably in jan  limited fsd beta releasing on tuesday next week as promised this will at first be limited to a small number of people who are expeamp careful drivers   the socs sync with each other 20 to 30 timessec exchanging output of nns that should be in harmony like a symphony so its fairly obvious when one is discordant  tesla fsd computers dual socs function like twin engines on planes  they each run different neural nets so we do get full use of 144 tops but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one soc or engine in this analogy fails  accurate analysis quite a few  egointelligencegtgt1 people in your comment thread haha neither mobileye nor nvidia which are certainly good companies could meet any of our capability schedule cost or power requirements           glad jen is safe   wow  uh ok here we go   i dont think this is accurate        yeah there are literally gt1000 more cameras than 10 years ago but still zero clear photos  even if half that amount its still a big deal          i have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting earth fuzzy pics that are worse than a 711 security cam frame grab dont count  we face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new its not a question of money if there was a great engineer factory we would place a large order unfortunately great engineers are very rare this is solved in the fsd build  definitely  exactly he plays the poor inventor card but was rich all along amp invented nothing as far as i know i went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 20082009 had no house amp had to borrow money from friends to pay rent  there are sketchy edits to tesla wiki that whitewash eberhards problemsglorify his role pretty odd i was interim ceococeo from july 2007 michael marks was coceo for q4 2007 amp zeev drori for q1 to q3 2008 after q3 2008 financing round bust no choice but to be ceo  when eberhard was fired from the tesla ceo role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me amp the board no one left with him that says it all  interesting the future of cars can and will be electric if the entire industry starts making and marketing compelling evs for everyone             spacextesla metallurgy amp new materials team is nextlevel   probably  i have that exact aon the wall of the place i stay in boca chica   yes failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake happened in most countries herd immunity for vast majority of people amp quarantine vulnerable was right though imo  sweden was right             there are sensitive elements but theyre on the inside also a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what ive posted and yeah anyone who can reverse engineer what ive posted doesnt need to reverse engineer  great work by spacex valve engineering amp production         our tiles are mechanically attached          it might be used in some areas itar laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions         tiles will be on hot side of flaps too a very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal  compilers need to improve imo most type pointer or other memory problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user   im proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha we put the 2020  model y long range electric suv on our test track to find out what it can doand it turns out well      norway leads the world  passed cryo proof      yeah its not a contest advanced casting crushes bestcase 3d printing but casting doesnt work well for complex enclosed volumes amp high strength or high temp alloys     great pics     maybe this should be the flag of mars  additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation   its already sensible for rocket engine parts to the best of our knowledge spacex is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive     pretty much but i think it may end on a high note starman last seen leaving earth made its first close approach with mars todaywithin 005 astronomical units or under 5 mill   meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release wont need to wait for fsd   it should be    exactly we barked up that tree for way too long sigh gives a false sense of victory being close  a tantalizing local maximum  but reality is just too messy amp weird our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once    yes we will play sexy snake jazz     yes   yeah provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler  waymo is impressive but a highly specialized solution the tesla approach is a general solution the latest build is capable of zero intervention drives will release limited beta in a few weeks   yeah we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5      great render note there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand amp ship to booster  mimecraft   yes   autopilot team is making great progress reality sure is complicated      aspiring to have no flame diverter in boca but this could turn out to be a mistake      we do have giant steel balls haha  we just completed a financing round but will let you know when there is another one     i definitely need to try these tasty cakes amp pastries on my next visit     mass ratio liquid oxygen is much denser than liquid methane even when the latter is cooled to just above its freezing point     had the most amazing kebab ever just outside of tacheles too bad that place got torn down it was awesome     döner kebab    youre most welcome    high bay should be finished except for the giant gantry crane within a few weeks super heavy stacking should begin around then    that looks tasty     the crash absorption rails can be cut off amp replaced with a bolted pafor collision repair   sandy munro understands engineering     that would be like licensing battlestar galactica actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard palots of people who worked at tesla gigafactories now work at competitors but none of those companies have made one    yes the gigafactory is the hardest amp most critical product    battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper amp lower face sheets eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity amp improved polar moment or inertia this is a major breakthrough   but now we understand production much better it will be our primary competitive advantage longterm   even gm amp chrysler went bankrupt in 2009 ford and tesla are the only us car companies that have avoided bankruptcy   the model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years but that was do or die for tesla no us car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in 100 years hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three   bringing a new product to volume production is 1 inspiration amp 99 perspiration you do still need that critical seed of inspiration but its fun amp takes 100 people production takes gt10000 people amp hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly  marginal cost of starship mass to orbit should be well under 100kg fully burdened cost depends on flight rate  prototypes are a piece of cake but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard takes much longer than people think to climb the production scurve i cant emphasize enough that production is by far the hard part  we do expect to make heavy use of lfp for medium range cars amp stationary storage  berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack amp front amp rear single piece castings also a new paint system   lot of new technology will happen in berlin which means significant production risk fremont amp shanghai will transition in 2 years when new tech is proven   they are  i do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart       7 bar absolute which is fine for flight this was a proof test rather than a burst test well hopefully fix the leak today amp retest      cryo pressure test succeeded but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts possibly due to differential shrinking     one of the best shots ever   much sooner     great photo   it will soon falcon 9 launches 60 starlink satellites to orbit completing spacexs 43rd flight of a previously flown rocket booster   once these satellites reach their target position we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern us amp hopefully southern canada other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval deployment of 60 starlink satellites confirmed    were not seeing notable differences yet i think the boosters could probably do 100 reflights some of the small composite helium tanks would need to be replaced maybe turbopump hot sections   roughly a week or two turnaround is all thats needed to meet max launch demand starship super heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour  ahem yes it was the 3rd flight of this booster amp 3rd flight for active half of fairing aiming for 10 flights of booster amp fairing by end of next year 4th flight amp landing for this booster  5 minutes from launch looks good so far   so crazy to subsidize pollution this is not good for people especially in dense cities with heavy traffic where your air intake is jammed up against another cars exhaust pipe  its a step in the right direction but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026 larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market turn volume to 11 amp play powerglide in your tesla     fsd will solve these issues music volume on a tesla goes to 11 because its louder than 10     one of my favorite writers foundation is tough to make into a movie but has outstanding potential     rewatched young frankenstein this weekend still awesome ovaltine   the remake has the potential to be great i kinda liked the original tbh but its possible to take it up a level hollywood should just stawith the sequel amp skip the original because financials  this article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of 5 or more presently amp 10x longterm        pretty wild considering that exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public 10 years ago new spacex droneship will be called a shortfall of gravitas nothing can escape gravity not even black holes and they really tried  would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while its driving  coming soon call of booty great game nan   vectorspace birds eye view coming with fsd   unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator   all of that and more were doing a broad review of launch site propulsion structures avionics range amp regulatory constraints this weekend i will also be at the cape next week to review hardware in person   exactly  we will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year  i agree with lex     glad youre ok   haha     thanks for waiting    next year for sure           oh yeah starship update coming in about 3 weeks the design has coalesced what is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as v10 with almost no changes          high frequency lasers are the way to go for sure          great         brownsville is quite far south so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity  needs several more starlink launches im using it at the little house i rent in the area definitely not good there yet       average latency will improve as more satellites launch directly above you more frequently amp more ground stations are deployed as were able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers legacy internet latency will be zero         very soon for higher latitudes like seattle        yes starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming      probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker although filling up the ship in orbit isnt required for mars so 4 is possible      starlink will be a revolution in connectivity especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged   yeah      great letter it will be increasingly difficult to see starlink satellites as were actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine amp scientific progress is not impeded     the ship rings are thicker than they need to be for now so same thickness works for booster amp ship for hoop stress booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling  its nextlevel      glad to hear your mom is ok      good to see inspiring for future of space       the new heat pump in model y is what really makes the difference in cold weather       yes coming soon       great render the circumferential welds amp skin panels will be much smoother in future builds      thats very hard to do have you tried pushing on the charge podoor to open its designed to suppoa manual press to open as well as automatic     its cool amp for sure can amp should be done but i suspect its best case will be more costly than wind amp solar aka big fusion reactor in sky  weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming starships  haha true why do showers have such a wide range     yes   light is not as fast as youd think once this dragon docks to the  there will be two dragons docked simultaneously between crew and cargo missions spacex training of astronauts that will fly on board dragons first operational mission is complete when the crew arrives for after launch of crew dragons first operational mission with astronauts on board spacex will launch its 21st cargo resupply mi  maybe we used too many magenta spotlights news were now targeting 240am et saturday oct 31 for the launch of the  and  crew1 mission to send ast   having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety    we will probably ipo starlink but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth amp predictable public market does not like erratic cash flow haha im a huge fan of small retail investors will make sure they get top priority you can hold me to it    fate loooves irony haha   glad spacex could help we are prioritizing emergency responders amp locations with no internet connectivity at all  true  thats total market not all tesla we do see tesla reaching 20m vehiclesyear probably before 2030 but that requires consistently excellent execution    total market   seven years for sure to 30m new fully electric vehicles per year six years maybe five years is possible but unlikely an extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials   both will do original cars  we arent cutting the price of model 3 to 25k i was referring to a future car that will be smaller than model 3   what about a heavy duty paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails   new version coming soon  suppliers were only doing high energy nickel ourselves at least for now also maybe the presentation wasnt clear that weve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months prototypes are trivial volume production is hard nan                if it passes australian regulations then sure     checking into it  totally up to you but if you head to a tesla delivery center near you amp maybe help out new owners that would be cool  completely agree  yes the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox no more hydraulics thanks tesla team for great work on deliveries for new owners we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics  there are times when i feel like im living in a dilbecartoon  that species has stood the test of time     mostly 304l some 301 broke at 301 to 304 interface sn9 will be all 304 also were making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture    8 bar differential in ullage 9 bar at base due to propellant head its enough improvements in work  we just need enough height to test body flaps amp drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks will do several flights to confirm working well then add heat shield amp go high mach first flight is to 15km or 50000 ft nosecone amp front flaps next week sn9 next month starship sn8 with rear body flaps     sure  true falcon 9 will launch  super cool interstellar mapping and acceleration probe imap which will help researchers better   not bad   exactly   sandy munro understands engineering  turns out they mostly press the letter s amp  on the typewriter   centaur with a bow obviously    haha  something like this   cant suppo3 wheel vehicles not safe enough  9007mm  something appealing about hawkinghartle idea but i agree with turokfeldbruggelehners   ur algo   true   there are some practical size constraints too cant be too big to fit in the engine compartment but it could be a little bigger 380 sec isp would be nice   doesnt seem to be a problem we could probably increase area ratio given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure    preburners ignite then main chamber  where is our prediction of probability inaccurate  or energy amp time but besides that what  genetic engineering is too slow unless you use a synthetic virus what cant we predict   yeah but might not need it  107 expansion ratio you can a little bit of flow separation towards the end of the nozzle completed a full duration test fire of the raptor vacuum engine at spacexs rocket development facility in mcgregor texas  rvac and sea level raptor with a human for scale  only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid    this does seem like the opposite of open openai is essentially captured by microsoft  haha true  maybe i will    jets are so cool    pretty much    yes   yahoo finance is as dumb as it sounds  yes   haha   roadster will be better  probably cybertruck atv roadster

goal 247365 and we will not stop not now not ever   i would like to point out that people who manufacture cashback in cro tend to dump it as soon as they get it so its in everyones interest for this behaviour to be eliminated which leads me to the last point  cro price   given the scale of our platform the number of people who abused our extremely customer friendly terms became simply impossible to ignore we had to tighten it up  the product offering is still extremely attractive but less prone to abuse now   on 2 majority of complaints relate to us removing cashback that frequently led to fraud and abuse ie on atm withdrawals via curve or sending money p2p on paypal the other frequent reason of complaints relates to abuse of our referral programs that led to cro clawbacks   on 1 we

find common ground we must    when the time comes to sell alts amp begin introducing measures to protect capital be assured i will be very vocal about it no matter the sentiment at that time i will complete what i have started then i will go and leave behind everything which is of illusionary monetary nature  i commented in several pieces the price action particularly around the 10k mark dont know what you are talking about everybody is making money in a bull market the real ais to navigate the fine line between selling too early and selling too late dont know what rsr is about but the btc pair sure looks interesting if it can break those highs  little cannabis amp psychedelic stock analysis session today its interesting because i never looked at these charts before will share results if deemed valuable what tickers should i add to my list if ltc is not on your radar this cycle i dont know what to tell you what beautiful writing giovannino guareschi was writing this in the 1960s about faith and mankind but you can read it a  increasing volume on buy candles little volume on sell candles marked with the green box in the lower area of the chart   after all these years  etceth   sc high break might be a good entry i do not know the sc market too well thus i am not overly confident whether that particular setup will do it definitely watching though   exact i trade using wicks instead of closes there is no right way though i know many traders using closes and they do very fine different traders different styles i have not forgotten dgb its on my radar would love to see a couple of days consolidation before breaking last high would likely serve a great entry strength is already evident though  solid work  really no idea bought it purely due to strong technical reasons its rare to see such sharp and clean pattern will hold and observe then see not attached to this bag but willing to hold as long as strength is provided   tmek knows zec nearing breakout marker impressive volume buildup so far  qtum with a clean break above key mark  taking a qtum long with break of 55 critical mark   more up across the board while alts gain more and more strength against

preparing to unleash worlds biggest shosqueeze in silver   xagusd on primexbt  going to jump on the silver trade weekly looks decent for rally continuation if highs can be broken silversqueeze   they have talked about it for so long but the internet is going to show them what effective markets are all about truth is that in a truly free market we folks would operate fine sure there are lessons to be learned accounts to be restarted  mastering the craft one step at a time  hedgefunds accustomed to rigging the game to their favor would be wiped quicker than they can say bailout nan ah its so great we are being protected by all these institutions so we dont burn our money in the markets such blessing nothing should happen nothing should be done to control or stop this let the free market decide  at this point wallstreet doesnt even care whether its blatantly obvious what they are doing the only thing that matters to them now is to save their own skin pretty convinced you will be able to buy a tesla with doge soon once a long time ago i became a huge fan of  the chrome app was smooth and i never encountered any problems whatsoever that means until they developed ledger live from which point on it was an utterly crappy experience to say the least will look for other ways now tell me more about how great it is to use a ledger  here are my unfiltered thoughts on what is happening burn it all down    wallstreet has evidently shown the whole world just how insanely rigged the system is congratulations you have just awoken the internet and the whole world is watching after delisting gamestop and amc robinhood has gotten over 100000 1 star reviews in one hour on the app store now set with the whole internet feels like a pirate ship right now xmrbtc looking strong right now consolidation seems over may get ready for second leg up  i am a contrarian trader  when the crowd mocks me for my investment choices i know i am on the right path when everybody agrees it is time to be very careful keep buying the hype i stick to my plan  wait two years and ill show you one  only in your mind   well keep buying whats cool  pretty sure thats a great investment strategy  why i am buying the original eth at 7 i dont know let me think about it its a sign  i never stopped buying zec amp etc by far the most important trade coming up this year is likely eth  already tapped ath in usd ratio working on a major trend reversal to be triggered with a new weekly high two strong technical reasons to expect a major rally   consolidation then omega pump with a new high eth just broke ath on finex  btc has reached breakout point of previous selloff bulls have to work through that level to get a new ath bears will use weakness here to shokey moment  a breakeven trade is a profitable trade the experience you gained for free is the profit that you capitalize on down the road christine lagarde on regulating bitcoin   there has to be regulation  because if there is an escape that escape will be used  you bet keep printing 3 the absence of solid buy patterns in lower timeframes is somewhat concerning patterns are all still in the process of forming the market has simply not yet decided how to proceed we need welldefined lower timeframes patterns to initiate a continuation rally still cautious 2 it is fair to note that the daily has lots of hours to go before closing so nothing is set in stone although the ema has been respected on multiple occasions losing the ema afterwards would indicate more consolidation needed lots of chop right now ema 20 on daily held impressively well over the last three days bounce likely  probably nothing   well at least zec is doing fine   aktivität mit altseason genau wie 2017 enough words of caution back to riding the trend in the history of bitcoin there were many flash crashes particularly after strong runs we have not seen one in this rally yet why would we assume this time is different just be prepared and appreciate it when it comes new highs will be made afterwards  it is reasonable to expect to see a blow off top after such strong rally in the not so distant future however i dont think this will lead to a prolonged bear market it is more likely we will see a cooldown and then a resumption of the rally just like it happened in mid 2013   there are many truths and everyone has their unique perspective i dont have a dog in this fight but i totally understand your boths statements id just argue saying he has no guts when he gave up literally everything to publish critical information is a little unfortunate  saying snowden doesnt have guts is a strange thing to say though bear setup invalidated after strong reclaim momentum stronger than expected taking the small loss here expecting very strong advance in the coming days   pretty sure i can trading the narrative  news is simply a game that wont work in the long run imho pretty huge rejection here with a h4 bear reversal if the bear setup is valid we should see gravity kicking in today approaching yesterdays low range   using two lines confuses my ability to interpret them usually i decide which lines best represents what i want to measure and then just stick with this one  there is no right way to use these lines i personally use wick lines so price has to react to that nothing else btc coming up for a retest of said line key moment reclaim or rejection  general targets for such potential extended correction would likely be around the 24k mark and 20k as a retest of old ath  line suppolost amp flush while a quick recovery is generally possible in order to get back above trendline much effois needed by the bulls who are now operating against gravity a more extended consolidation period is more likely at this stage   hold line suppoand generate a new higher high and we enter parabolic advance stage lose the line suppoand trade below and gravity begins to kick in retest of top channel line in progress this better holds   try binance but withdraw coins never store on exchanges remember when elon kindly invited you to the doge adventure two weeks ago  invalidated without activation back to observation only setup i am interested in right now shorting the break of last low with a sl above last high trade invalidated if high is taken out before trigger reason is we are trading well above top channel line first signs of weakness not saying the trend ends here but if it does  shorting any weakness in this altitude with a break of last low if this parabolic advance fails it probably fails here low risk tight stop great rr attempting the parabolic advance   no group twitter is my main comm channel cancelled the shoorder for now back to observation longs still open  pretty sure you have it all figured out  experimental in this context means that i am willing to place the trade based on ta and rr but am not totally convinced its a good idea it also implies rather smaller position size due to the same reason  impossible as i am very conserative with my shortterm trades way less than 1 risk per trade  once trendline suppois lost gravity might kick in just being very cautious in this altitude and the uberbullish sentiment tapped the top channel line losing the ground here and i am putting on a experimental shonot a fan of shorting strong uptrends but rr wise this might end up a fantastic trade  for the record this exists   twosided sword really a rising wedge is a bearish formation but can break up instead resulting in a very strong breakout ultimate decision will be made when price is above the top line probabilitywise drop is more likely but in a strong bull it could spike way higher decisiontime coming up for btc today price attempting to break above top channel line which either results in a strong breakout parabolic advance or a local top being formed if price losing trendline suppoagain failed breakout prepared for either scenario stops tight   there is always another layer of understanding with any further read pure magic recommending his video course as well very complementary to the book 1inch the market that keeps on giving shorterscalpers paradise   what can i say it was always clear to me that this wont end well nontheleess i am sad for those who fully believed in xrp though its a hard pill to swallow and a hard loss to take  we are talking about one single shortterm trade that i decided to close there are more positions for the longer run with lower entries that will remain open i aim to be prepared for either scenario  what if it doesnt and all your profits evaporate stopped out taken the win can always reenter long if price action proves to be bullish  i honestly dont know im just protecting my profits because potentially it could turn into panic just being cautious in this altitude plan for this trade was long into the 265  275k area so taking profit profit was very reasonable after this initial sign of weakness can always reenter with another setup  tight stops on my btc longs now not giving away profits in this altitude outlining the setup hype very high on twitter so thats a bearish indication to me upleg seemed exhaustive shorted in anticipation of triangle suppobreaking amp a temporary downtrend forming trailing sl at respective lower highs locked in 300 as trend structure broke  props to  for quick assistance sending some  over merry christmas we all continously learn dont take the bragging on twitter at face value for every trader has his own challenges and most wont show when they fucked up just a reminder to focus on improving your own game instead of blindly following comic avatars pretending to be perfect what actually happened woke up saw 1inch hype decided to shoon binance shorted in the wrong trade section had to ask my binance pro bud  for assistance who helped me to get out of the trade and enter in the proper derivates section then made 300 example shorted 1inch due to hype for a quick 300 roe great trade dont believe everything you see on twitter most of the time things are very different from what they seem to be the time between christmas and new year is probably the most important time of the year taking the time to meditate and reflect on what happened during this year as well as planning ahead for the next see you in january amp merry christmas to all of you     normies be like   tightening stops particularly on my btc longs not willing to give away profits bc of this situation tightening stops worried about potential of xrp imploding if suppodoesnt hold and the resulting repercussions in the overall markets might be a nonevent just making sure i dont stand on the beach when the tsunami hits what i dont like about this xrp situation is that it drags down the altcoin marketcap with it making it generally more difficult for other alts to turn around  perspectives change over the years no shame in that it was a great trade early on but signs were very apparent at some point that things just go the wrong way with ripple so i sold all and suggested the same to my followers friendly reminder that after initially buying at half a cent i warned investors about ripple by posting an article literally on the day xrp hit its highest ever price of 331  will be in nature for the solstice  come to my family party with a drone and i show you what a jedi can do to a drone i guess cant wait for the uk police raids christmas family dinner videos going viral on twitter imagine believing that the government can forbid you to spend quality time with your family on christmas lmao cant wait for elon to pump my doge bags into the stratosphere  must not happen from here we could go higher into 25  30k and still drop into 20k ath like a stone either way being prepared is the way to go it is quite probable that 20k will be retested at some stage stopping out late fomo longs in the process i dont like to bet against the trend but im sure using tight stops in this altitude buying 20k will be a gift  laddering take profits wouldnt be so much of a hustle in mania stage if i long altusdt pairs with btc collateral i not only multiply my btc holdings but btc has probably risen in value at the same time netting in double profits  just curious even if you wouldnt believe in altseason we would probably agree to disagree and move on wouldnt worse liquidity mean that in case of the positive alt scenario playing out prices can rise quicker relatively seen  so you dont believe in another altseason in the first place  would you share your most trusted decentralized exchanges  the way i think about it is that once you have btc what then you can either save hold or reinvest multiply imho most will want to further seize the opportunities by multiplying their btc holdings via alts should they pick up momentum  well its a matter of what we expect the markets to be doing like in 2017 i am expecting alts to escalate at some stage at least attempting to do a similar thing than btc so as a result of that perspective riskrewardwise a welltimed entry in altsusdt pairs is a ev move  thing is btc has gone some ways already finding an entry that will not be retested in the later stage of the trend may become difficult i like to enter early alts havent started their journey yet so these prime opportunities still exist  generate wallets on an offline computer making sure the private key has never touched the internet it is worth the effoto spend a day researching the best methods for doing proper cold storage  in this case spot means buying the real coins no margin cold storage refers to the method of securely storing btc on an offlinegenerated wallet where the private key has never touched the internet most rewarding play this season will be longing altusdt pairs with btc collateral at the right time convince me otherwise  still figuring out the details and exact pairs momentarily interested in buying the following pairs at their respective momentum triggers  dogeusdt dgbusdt zecusdt current plays  longterm margin positions in btc for absurdly high targets solid spot bags of most promising altcoins btc in cold storage  upcoming plays  addon to alt spot bags at breakouts margin long altusdt pairs at the right time again for absurdly high targets   look how the obv already indicates the breakout solid buy volume on green candles ltcbtc for the ltcusd pair to go parabolic we need the ratio kicking trendline broken and retested now waiting for the trigger w a new higher high might be the moment   ltc is just getting started i am here for four digits remember when ltc started to gear up one month ago congratulations to everyone who has taken the signal early   its  over  33 price discovery initiated  everyone who has ever gone shoin the entire history of bitcoin is now underwater  congrats fellow bulls  btc bitcoin what happens after btc breaks ath is a oneofakind situation that has never been experienced in this shape or form   literally anything can happen ultimatively decided by market participants be prepared and buckle up the show is about to begin   when i see gender comments under my posts  excellent take on the paramount privacy issue in crypto by     gotta love monero   same trade lets go  whatever that project is about so many reasons to buy well done give this man a follow    deserved the pattern was so clean and sharp i am surprised the entry tweet didnt gather more attention tbh af i dont think its unreasonable to expect btc continuing to move up towards the end of year to print a very strong 12m breakout candle by now it would be the highest ever yearly close closing above ath would make it even more impressive  bright future  forgot to attach the chasee text above  triangle tip in the process of being recaptured after ema retest needs to move up from here to confirm if successful expecting momentum increase and strong acceleration once we break ath if trump actually pardons assange itll be the single greatest act any us president has done in my lifetime   definitely ra     been on my list for a long time thanks for the reminder after resting in my tabs for weeks i have finally taken the time to read the absolute fantastic piece of  explaining the similarities between bitcoin amp funghi one of the best articles ive read in a long time perfect for a sunday afternoon read   btc approaching trendline  this is hilarious and really well done big shoutout to the creator of this     y                              l                             n                             e impressive volume xmr   daily hasnt closed below yet and has about 11 hours to go still interesting to note is that ema 200 currently resides at the same mark 17500 in h4  bulls failed to immediately drive the price up currently second attempt to reach breakout point suppoaround 1750017200 after stopping out frontrunner longs setup got invalidated without the trade having been triggered still flat  i have been holding and adding btc and alts for a long time this is a setup i take with a minor fraction of my liquid balance  a possibility bullish setups that fail can become shoentries but wouldnt take it in current market condition  seen it from another perspective if the bull reversal bar can get triggered it might invite enough momentum into the market to remain above the middle bollinger daily close justifies an entry at one tick above the closed candle as an ema20 bull reversal setup in trend direction after three waves of correction sl below if trend is still active setup should yield a strong leg up into trend continuation orders set good night  youtubes reasoning for the new policy is essentially you are not allowed to criticize the government  snapshot of current chasituation breakout point got frontrun by a small margin emas still crossed to the upside bulls need to recapture triangle tip and close above for rally continuation  if btc daily candle closes here or higher it will be an entry bar at ema20 in trend direction with stop loss below volume will likely be higher at the end of day further confirming the bull reversal still about 10 hours until daily close so anything can still change      i read the article it had surprisingly little to do with the brexit as indicated in the headline  kîng of all markets and 117 followers    amusing how a 2 selloff in crypto is assigned to fears of a nodeal brexit while in fact nobody in crypto bats an eye could as well replace the headline with bitcoin took an over 2 dip on tuesday as just another monolith shows up in britain over fears of alien invasion first upper triangle boundary needs to be retaken then break above 19500 highs for the bullish scenario playing out momentum acceleration afterwards weakness to reverse up from here could lead to a move down 17500 first likely stop breakout point of previous rally  after attempted break of the triangle price plunged back into the lower boundary this is where price should bounce and continue picking up momentum to the upside otherwise move into 17500 likely  it does pump was a failure indicating more retesting needed apai have witnessed different alts pumping out of the blue bt btc almost never followed up in a real bull season alts occasionally move first with btc following indicates we are not there yet still transitioning  the bilderberg is not the center though this rabbit hole goes deep   i do not worry about price implications resulting from their regulation rather it is the direction of completely eradicating privacy amp anonymity from this space by forcing every service amp exchange to impose kyc on its users in order to get a operating licence  getting in bed would indicate something positive i reckon we must do everything possible to make sure the currency monopoly remains in the hands of states means more like buckle up we have seen enough lets regulate crypto to death before it melts our scam economy down ltc trying to tell us something  entered xmr spot as price found suppoin lower range xmrusd pair looking towards new highs here as well  the end goal of education is to be able to silence the mind 1 bitcoin grows in hype cycles that mimic fungal reproduction   weve entered stage 2 mushroom bull market   quick  very interesting thanks for elaborating  thats entirely correct  curious as i am not a candlestick trader doesnt the high wave spinning top need to be triggered to be valid  sure another drop might be happening but given all things i am comfortable taking the risk for the potential reward truly profitable patterns will not be found by excessive search but by it immediately catching your attention so effortlessly that you simply cannot unsee it for its potential  matter of perspective depends on where you measure the end of the third wave of correction in my view we are in the green box if compared to the fractal you shared   you wont because im tired of comments like that farewell  thats the interesting question isnt it i bet on initial blood in alt ratios as soon as btc shows its true face strong parabolic spikes alts will rise against usd until they have enough momentum to turn the ratio up so if there is a bloody dip in alts it might be bargains  talk no more i feel you bro  demographic of traders has continued increasing its shopositions since september over the same time period bitcoin btc 098 has gained 60  says all     i dont care i am prepared for either scenario you are purely argueing based on assumptions i am just analyzing charts go do your thing   supply drying up coins are being gobbled up by exchanges institutions and individuals alike in addition the number of lost keys in this past decade will be extremely high better be safe and send some btc into cold storage be safe   thanks im doing fine remember a top is always relative you will be surprised   ltc dgb anon coins as zec xmr zec and etc are by far my riskiest positions but well worth the riskreward holding some eth but not main focus doge as a meme that will pay off in due time  i do hold doge spot would have loved to gobble up more around 15sats if we get there i will otherwise i will keep on holding  i dont work with timebased exits at all the trend is over when the structure breaks and hlhhs turn into lhlls if i had to guess though it will be between mid and end 2021 the ain margin trading longterm positions is to enter so early that your entry will not be touched in the later course of the trend it truly is an aif you dont know exactly what you are doing just hold spot and be fine margin  stress minimize stress if you are risk affine longterm margin positions can be planted here in alts if you go for absurdly high targets but if you take your chances with that make sure its a tiny amount of your total portfolio dont lose your stack bc of greed just before the global big run begins this is not the time for risky margin positions  there rarely ever is this is the time to focus and accumulate solid coins spot store it safely and build a solid foundation for future financial independence be firm with your approach follow your plan and reap the rewards further thoughts about this particular setup emas still crossed up so upside breakout more likely general trend is up dailyweeklymonthly three waves of correction completed indicated as yellow hlhh trend reversal initiated not triggered yet  that will be the entry    wouldnt outrule it straight away what is the fair value of litecoin its almost as ancient and reliable as btc quicker as well let mimblewimble come in and provide confidential transactions 10 of btcs value is not improbable imho but thats just my two cents  sure if you want more certainty but i expect volatility around that ath level so i want to be in as early as possible to avoid getting scamwicked out of a good trade also rr is way better from here so i am willing to take the risk if the trend is still up setup should unfold   ratio will rise when ltcusd begins ascend imo it will be litecoins year especially if btc continues to be strong historically ltc liked btc strength very much one of the rare coins that is able to follow suit  if it is one there must be a strong breakout from pretty much here as is the one i am anticipating three waves of correction completed as well within the handle so this does not look too bad give the trend is up we should expect follow up soon  you mean this one person not understanding the rationale behind ltc couldnt care less still remains my biggest bag adding more with more confirmation is that a risky trade sure but its a calculated risk closing above ath will likely result in a strong spike a move that could yield several thousand for a risk of 600ish dollars a trade i would take any time in this situation willing to take this long in anticipation of bullish triangle break into price discovery

have withdrawn my funds and will be dumping cov at the first opportunity next nonkyc exchange  depends on how this dump is being assessed just a consolidation buy at next suppocomplete meltdown and trend reversal better buy very low i suspect its the former  sure the ema20 works on all timeframes but before touching the weekly ema we need to break the daily ema suppofirst which is where we are now currently trading above ema again its a sta  i am a buyer down here already filled a great deal of positions i am having some more room in case we dip one more time but i think that was it if you were a buyer two days ago and dont want to buy today at bargain do yourself a favor and stop trading after all eth just hit previous high suppo btc touched ema 20 on daily selloff should stop here   imagine some day in the future 1 btc buys you several hundreds to a thousand ounces of gold that would be a bet i will surely take if we ever get in such unfathomable territories there will be a time when digital currencies boom so incredibly much that holding precious metals will become widely unpopular and generally a thing of the past expressing plans to buy gold will result in bewilderment and ridicule thats when you buy as much as you can carry what if  eth 20 fails and etc becomes the original eth that it always was plot twist   buy original eth at 7 downside quite limited potential upside irrationally high what can possibly go wrong in the meanwhile over at grayscale ethereum classic trust impressive volume buildup they clearly know something volume precedes price etc  so apparently the grayscale litecoin trust is in full fomo mode currently trading at around 500 i dont pretend to understand what is going on there but im sure glad i have a heavy bag of ltc   liked the question as well thanks for the kind words striving to be of servicemay abundance flow with you  i am evaluating technically here generally the confidentialanonymity bet is a longterm strategy and should be diversified into all existing anon coins like the ones you mentioned ltc will likely have confidentials soon zen might be another candidate technially zecs ready  it opened way higher actually depending on where you look the emission algorithm is reverse from bitcoin meaning that first there were only fractions of zec in existence supply became bigger with more time elapsed early btc miners got lots of coins early now less reversed zec is in the process of completing a higher lowhigher high major trend reversal to be activated with trigger of august high around 100 mark in a

any true geeks out there willing to help with advice lost touch with these things a decade ago  funds will trickle down and there will be a golden alt season eventually the one does not exclude the other but it would be too painful sitting in small caps while the whole space especially large caps goes parabolic hoping your coin too will see the light  i am just using my brains stick to your math  nature of investing is diversification nobody wants to place their bet on just one coininvestment but spread it to the most probably most promising crypto is a new innovation and needs a long time to be fully trusted players will look to diversify in order to protect imho  if you think things are going to slow down from here you are mistaken we are nearing climax of modern mankind time events and intensity will only accelerate from here brave yourself   i do not consider etc being paof this category especially with all these 51 attacks this is purely a speculative gamble as it always was it is known that it is accumulated by institutional players for whatever etc has in store for us in the future willing to take a bet  i wish by far the biggest mistake anyone in this space can make in this upcoming rally is to sell too early this bull market will reach heights and dimensions of unseen unexplainable and completely irrational behavior of unfathomable scale hold your hands tight and be patient when citizens companies and wealthy individuals from all over the world are faced with ongoing fiat value decline and begin to look to protect their capital what do you think they are going to buy  the most reliant big caps like btc eth ltc or your new fancy shitcoin  the oldest most reliable proven and safe chains generally distancing from anything new and innovative with a lot of hype this season i will hold far less coins than in previous rallies i do expect serious fomo into bitcoin and big caps due to worsing global economical conditions dont sell too early this might become costly down the road i decided which coins i want to ride a long long time ago now is the time to execute this will be legacy coin season  wanted to add more dgb but my bag is heavy enough with low average entry price current price is not attractive to me to add on to and drag up my avg buy price in the past weeks and days i have added substantial bags of ltc eth zec etc amp doge early entry

whatever reasons cannot access it by just entering the key vaults can be opened not certain about ledger anymore afaik you can only extract private keys if you enter passphrases so thats unsafe what happens if ledger live goes down many questions would prefer offlinegenerated wallets with safely nondigitally stored priv keys  create keys on offline computer never enter the private key until you definitely want to spend dont save the priv key digitally find ways to store the priv offline so that only you can access plenty of guides out there research suggested if you have lots of btc and not a single one secured in a cold storage wallet i strongly encourage you to do so  time soon last call for ltc with a break above 70 high ema cross pending triggering is a buy every dip below that level

all over the world are not looking to strengthen encryption means for citizens but are pursuing the exact opposite  if you genuinely think the eu is not intending to get access to encrypted messaging tools you are friggin delusional 1 but they will ban bitcoin  let me quickly explain why this threat is highly overestimated and why it is not possib  so its not correct that the eu wants to implement backdoors in encrypted messaging apps    the real story is btc  this visualization of the 10 trillion stimulus shows the total utter monetary insanity of our times  bitcoin isnt spe          at least

ltc coming up with a major signal on weekly imminent ema cross with successful breakout    thats for sure there might be serious delays    perpetually takeoff soon bitcoin trending again in germany  search trends for bitcoin and buy bitcoin right now  9 i firmly stand with my strong opinion that primexbt is the most excellent exchange i have ever used in my career my sincere apologies if my poor articulation has trampled on anyones toe i do hope this thread has clarified what i truly meant thanks for your honest feedback 8 although i am on the board i did not promote my own fund for this was not the reason for the tweet i stand with saying that covesting is a big upcoming trend amp that the idea as such is proper it requires however both the professionalism of the fund manager and investors 7 from my own experience i affirm that the greater responsibility has forced me to be even more considerate about the risk i take and how to protect the funds of my followers for their pain is my pain and and vice versa 6 if you have not been trading seriously and very dedicated for years dont even think about creating a fund this would be the definition of irresponsibility the likelihood that you get wiped and with that the funds of your investors will leave a serious mark on skins 5 even more about risk management and how to protect profitsfunds for yourself and other investors and in the process refining the professionalism in your trading 4 after all this is what a professional does managing and reducing risk what i actually attempted to emphasize is that when you have reached a certain professional level in your own trading  taking the next step up  increasing responsibility may serve as a catalyst to learn 3 by no means is it advised to trade with strangers money if you havent completely mastered it for yourself and even when you are a professional you have to be able to operate with great responsibility always knowing that the risk you take affects others big time as well 2 it appeared like i do encourage novice traders to trade with other peoples money in order to learn this is not at all the case i definitely strongly discourage creating a fund if you dont know exactly what you are doing on a professional level i was reflecting a lot about my previous covesting tweet and the reactions received i would like to genuinely apologize to my followers for the words displayed did not reflect the true meaning of what i believe this thread attempts to clarify  kinda feel bad about it tbh sometimes words appear different from how they are meant thanks for letting me know what you think hope people will be getting my true meaning when i elaborate later on  i agree it is not what i meant really i admit it was poorly articulated will write a statement about it later today as i was reflecting a lot about it  i dont bat an eye people sell their scam shit all over the place yet here i am doing a onetime promotion for the handsdown most excellent exchange i have ever used in my life   in 1 week btc 3d on balance volume looking good expecting acceleration soon    btc high got triggered then nuked however this is not necessarily a sign that we are not going to proceed rising expecting btc to trade higher towards the weekly close tonight   irresponsible behavior of fund managers andor investors is not the fault of covesting though i def agree there are lots of gamblers out there and this needs to be viewed with caution but this doesnt mean the core idea of social investing is bad  disagree in order to receive investments you have to proof you are trading well having the responsibility of people riding your back is a gamechanger and teaches you things about your trading that you did not know before trading in a healthy competitive environment is ev covesting is the future i urgently recommend every serious trader willing to improve to create a social fund and learn to trade w the responsibility of other peoples money steep learning curve amp lots of lessons in riskmoney management     there currently is still resistance at that level so a dip might occur before breaking these levels once triggered way should be clear above reassess after breakout  another dip possible what is critical is that it generates a strong breakout on volume when triggered potential cascade towards 16k trigger needs to generate  enough momentum to break 13764 basically no resistance above that level   i buy the token on another exchange and use the funds to pump the price up  i actually used it back in the days without problems but it seems they are doing this on a regular basis they income model must be selling data to the government lmao  intended to buy a token that is only there and some other exchange that forces kyc by default but yeh we constantly learn dont we   they better fix this asap or i will spread the word to 200k people simple as that obviously the only protection my funds need is from you  you say no kyc needed to trade and withdraw up to limit yet you immediately freeze my account and force me to kyc when trying to withdraw you got to be kidding me   100200 last tweet about ltc enough said weekly chapending break emas would cross bullish as a result 69 break and its gone good luck all   yes  ltc dependent on btc continuation indeed reason why ltc might go for a moonshot soon ltcbtc working on break of previous high which could generate sufficient fuel for a break of major significant trendline in proximity above no advice just my opinion and current play  long and strong ltc  initial investment doesnt matter invest what you can deal with losing buy amp hold is still my preferred tool using alts as an instrument to multiply holdings dont sell too early drop your positions when the hype hits mainstream hard and usual signs of bubble occur  your thoughts create your reality i assure you you can and you will when you play your cards right this season financial independence will be with you for the rest of your life that is  if you play your cards right when you are finally rich because thats an entirely different game we are all going to make it    the idea is simple if this is bottom  which i think it is  ltc will go to four digits i will sell my position for a multiple of btc which by then has substantially risen in value too this way i generate way more profits than by simply holding btc planting runners    then buy btc sholtc and see how that goes for ya  thats exactly what the sentiment was when i bought at 4 cycles repeat ltc will melt faces four digits mark my words   dude your lack of understanding of the mechanics is disturbing why be so vocal if you have no clue about the mechanics rising ltcusd will turn around ltcbtc when sellers are exhausted then the ratio will be kicking and ltc goes straight i will come back to this   its just an assumption you have that ltcbtc will go to zero which is simply ignorant as on the of the oldest most reliant chains with greater speed than btc tell me exactly why it will go to zero   you do understand though that a rising ltcusd price will be beneficial for ltcbtc   remind me 3 months ltcusd getting ready one of the coins i expect to closely follow btc movements   likely the same here strong btc move will likely force dgbbtc further down the drain i am a buyer at lower levels i suppose altusd pair should be fine as btcs move would drag their value up turbulences likely though am long btcusd ltcusd ethusd patiently waiting for bottoms in their respective btc pairs for takeoff dont underestimate the impact of a strong btc move on altbtc pairs my best guess is we see one more round of blood before bottoming out imho btc not finished attacking 14k   that might be willys opinion and im sure it works well for him i am more interested in how many people are actually sitting down for the first time to research the term bitcoin because they will turn to buyers along the road used this chafor a long time with good results   institutions buy early masses buy late thats where you are selling  its not the institutions we want to sell our coins to nothing yet   am long ltcusd trigger in ltcbtc would just make it escalate more  i dont think we have to wait that long actually i do want to see alts reactions to the real breakout of btc that is coming imho this pump today was just the beginning then reevaluate wait for proper patterns in altsbtc and then place longterm bets in qualitative projects  id argue that language changes over the course of years especially if its not your native language but well i will proceed whether people believe this account was sold or not still love you all   i am however positive that i have changed quite dramatically throughout all these years and especially with the gap many perspectives changed working on my own obstacles in life people grow and change just natural imho   this rumour doesnt really make sense to me i came here for the revolution and idealistic reasons i do believe i have strong morals selling my account for more money thereby handing over all my followers to some rich predator not my style never gonna happen   have i really changed that much during my absence   bitcoin has been going off well and will continue let them sellers drop what they want to drop around here they will buy back higher later btc drags up usd value of alts but alts drop against btc until the selling is absorbed time to plant seeds in alts is coming very soon 13   join the positive valuation gang   250000 sir i

you invested in a scam and your chief is dumping on you on a regular basis   remind me 3 months  if you want clarity go to work and get a guaranteed paycheck the upside scenario for btc is unusually clear breaking 12500 will generate plenty of momentum towards 14000 if that 14k high gets taken out as well btc will be full throttle on the way towards ath and above   this would be triangle breakout point zone    trading on primexbt without interest rates    why at nov 4 though  4 digits if the strong breakup occurs i am long btc eth ltc on leverage with absurdly high targets if we get rejected and meltdown instead my first targets would be in the 9400  9500 area for a triangle breakout point retest  bullish but the danger of breakdown is apparent and i am ready to shoif meltdown occurs decision time means that market hasnt decided yet and will end with a violent move in either direction once that decision has been made by market participants having a plan for either scenario is essential in current market situation us election drama is around the corner with turbulences to be expected in legacy markets and us dollar strength should be a fascinating period for all global markets these situations can but must not produce entries into the major developing trend things change very quickly when it violently dumps instead if price accelerates here however the trend will develop strongly in any way decision time is approaching fast get your popcorn ready same goes for ethusd albeit most bullish crosses happened just recently so it is lagging behind a little bit all emas are crossed upwards in every single timeframe from weekly all the way down to minutecharts btc decision time soon  nothis isnt the stockmarket  its negative yielding debt  another reason to be long us treasuries   i think i have seen this one before   bears and bulls terms are just a tool to describe supply and demand behavior of market participants  12490 was the high point of the year not sure what you want to imply with the rest you said recent btc breakout was legit but more effoneeds to be coming from the bulls price action remains in a threewave corrective move after bearish impulsion break of 11740 amp 12500 highs needs to commence otherwise bears might try to force more consolidationdownside   the truth is the truth irrespective of how the information has been obtained  will check thanks for the input entries with multiple highs in close proximity tend to benefit from sudden impulsions as each individual level provides another catalyst for renewed demand   just an eternal student if the information helps you understand some aspects of trading more glad to be of service  invalidated the right shoulder nonetheless triggered the lows and went into temporary selloff however price was able to recover which adds to the bullish narrative stops of shorts are placed at red and should additionally fuel the move to come   if this is a fakeout btc is in big trouble to say the least a trader needs to be flexible and able to reverse hisher temporary bias with more information available strong opinion weakly held upside resolution of triangle has opened up opportunity to long the potential beginning of developing trend w several highs stacked in proximity expecting strong breakout with trigger of yesterdays breakout bar setup invalidation below 10540 first target in 11800 area  bullish case is in play   btc w bullish triangle break on rising volume   meditation is the answer brings you in touch with your subconscious developing intuition on the way i always decide for what my gut feeling is telling me it is the sum of all factors that i am able to observe in the chaplus the strength of subconscious intuition that concludes what my conscious mind cannot perceive  nothing would make me happier than erring on that one but objectively thats what i see happening if there is a bullish surprise in the making bring it on  i dont think this way news dont drive price it is supply and demand determining the fair price of an asset if btc breaks down from here in two weeks everybody will say it was obvious all this bad news price was just lagging why didnt i shoetc  6070 in favor of breaking down i remain bearish for the time being 10k suppowas tested but lack of strength is apparent price action is weak no volume breaking last low of 9882 would likely trigger massive selling across the board bearish until convinced otherwise by bull strength btc bullish arguments upside resolution of minor triangle would lead price back into bullish territory having respected important trendline amp emas on multiple occasions  btc bearish arguments downward resolution of minor triangle would lead price way below important trendline amp below crucial 10k suppo  hf gl  not looking for longs at the moment am sho10880 amp 10655 want to see another retest of recent lows  convincing price action if the low at 9800 doesnt hold i would let it run btc breakdown occured after yet another retest of resistance and failed bull break  cant say it isnt there btc   id agree however the impact of the dollar strength on crypto is undeniable trends that are being initiated here might continue far beyond the shoterm so in essence this has medium to longterm implications one can have faith in bitcoin while at the same time be objective about the temporary weakness of current price action few know this  nothing would make me happier than seeing btc decoupling from the dollar and its correlation with legacy markets as of now the opposite is the case at least momentarily  still wrong tho  gents im talking about a shortmidterm development outlined in my repoearlier     not more not less if we pump from here so be it but right now i see barely anything that makes me believe we are in for an immediate leg up quickly losing confidence in btc barely able to pump when the dollar index consolidates but quick to dump when it actually shows some signs of strength set stops to break even dont like the price action at all feels like more consolidation needed back to observation mode not really confident in that long followup was quite weak expected a stronger breakout eventually taking out last high will let it roll for the sake of it but with tight sl if the setup fails this only confirms my rather bearish bias due to strong us dollar  taking this long if setup comes to fruition as dump attempt seemingly failed  some insights into current market conditions of crypto forex and legacy markets all depending on the developing strength of the us dollar    eth with a long setup after break of recent low failed push could drive price through trendline  xauusd attempting a downside break of a symmetrical triangle note that gold is currently trading at old ath levels yellow line if price cannot sustain current levels targeting 1770 zone to cover shorts   its easy to hit the keyboard and spit some crap its more

consolidation would be great to position   thanks i would love to write every letter as straightforward as the last one unfortunately market situations are seldom that clear yes position remains open using a tight sl to catch the majority of the leg other half will ride the developing trend until it fades  read it again i said in reference to the post of july 21st i posted this setup  its a trailing system aimed to capture most of the movement before getting stopped out in profit during first real consolidation some ages ago i outlined this trailing system more elaborately bear in mind its an ancient article   update  in reference to the btc trade setup posted on july 21st  entry 9500 triggered with intial stop at 9000ish  split positions 12 aimed at capturing the majority of the developing leg other 12 aimed at capturing the larger trend   sl 1 tight adjusted to 11222  its been a great pleasure to partake in a rather elaborated interview with utopia p2p discussing a variety of topics including but not limited to crypto decentralization the utopia project and some of my own history in this space enjoy the read   btc trend continuation is expected as breakout point has been successfully retested entry with break  new higher high in trend direction   four digits may the patience be with you 10500 broken brace yourselves  the king is on the move for the sake of completeness    could be interpreted as weakness and just another lower high which in turn could invite bears to showith relatively low risk compared to the potential reward of a major breakdown their stops would then be above 10500  still weary on alts at this stage generally if btc breaks up from here it would likely result in chaos across the board if btc breaks down violently from here it would definitely result in chaos across the board so either way better be cautious  what makes the pattern confirmed in your view  the goal should be to enter as the movement is expected not after the move happened   it might sticking to my own chafor these levels to confirm  in this case finex and bitmex to clarify this is the mark im observing  we are not in safe territory yet in fact unless 10500 is taken out this area remains the most dangerous of all btc must break 10400  10500 key level otherwise this leg would turn out to be just another lower high exciting day ahead    is this the day for btc to finally break free above 10500 the path is clear  now trading above  10k level will be key to break said trendline is around 9800ish at the moment due to upside momentum it wouldnt surprise me if we just glide through and even gain more momentum due to trendline invalidation just making sure it is being said btc price approaching trendline which has been respected on multiple occasions must mean nothing as momentum is on the buyside however interesting situation to observe as we approach this line from below  ltc triggered first entry level at 46 now looking at the highs around the 50 mark as a critical level to break which in turn provides a qualitative trendbased entry long  update ltc takeout of high at 46 occurred serving as an early entry long level of 50 will remain critical to break  dgb triggered 255 running upwards 300 sats is the big one to break  dgb close to break of key level 255  ok there is the first lift in the bb squeeze now we need to see follow through or well be setup for real trouble a head fak  yoga nidra would be a good way to get an easy entry into sleep meditation there is tons of material available on yt  meditate before sleep to tune into a higher vibrational state for the night will also aid quality of sleep apafrom that use regular meditation as a means to bring to surface that which haunts you at night and resolve it for good several charts at the brink of breakout above htf key levels historically thats when btc comes in and invalidates them all buckle up its make it or break it moment for crypto i am however opposed to the idea of entering this long before the actual break of 9500 as one higher low is not enough to justify an entry only the break of recent high will make the reversal a legit signal long likewise similar picture in ltc one of the few alts that i expect to follow a strong btc move currently in range forming a higher low reversal within takeout of 46 high could lead to a move up leaving the range above 50 would be critical for longterm trend  potential higher low reversal in the making with a break above 9500 high sl would be placed at last low around 9025 if breakout is successful setup would be seen as confirmation of emas supporting more upside critical level to be taken out will remain at 10500   burned through several laptops in the past years however acer predator is a steady beast despite heavy usage  promising but cautious right now about alts setups look good but a violent move could invalidate those alt patterns easily observing   enjoy the silence btc will soon change that btc ema 20100200 analysis  weekly emas crossed up 3d emas crossed up daily emas crossed up 4h emas bundled at current price 1h emas bundled at current price 15m emas bundled at current price  if the bullish trend is to be resumed this is the time otherwise   indeed thanks thoughts concerning btcs current range the situation in alts and the potential impact of traditional markets on crypto     unless taking out 0002 or getting out anywhere close to this high the chatells me to have more patience and wait for more information legacy markets dragging down btc   possible in this market situation there is basically only two options left strong breakout or violent collapse bears had their chance to break down on multiple occasions so bulls get their chance now using the bears losses as fuel volume already higher than fifty or so periods prior amp candle still has about 15h before close further volume increase and strong close without wicks on top would be preferable  while btc is breaking alts reaction will give us important indication of where we stand in the market cycle and whether or not they will be ready to form sustainable uptrends without a further prolonged consolidation  im able to change my views with more datainformation available as should any trader not trading on dogma btc break above 9400 high would force bears out of position awaiting volatility and spike  published new post btc bear trap scenario pending completion    despite the uncertainty around a potential btc move zec displays an early entry breakout potential that i am observing closely at this time   you know i am operating and sharing from my own experiences in the markets which is the past and try to spread what i have learned as undistorted as possible right now i see this danger and make aware of it for may it be of use for whoever is open to this thought  nobody is stopping you go ahead  this has been thought many times in the past only with the eventual and painful realization that btc is and will remain the king of coins i tend to trust that cycles repeat while alts pop across the board i remain cautious about the possibility of btc suddenly ending this momentum with an impulsive move like it often did in the past enjoy the profits while this phase lasts but always stay viligant  in the past they followed each others moves closely so when dgb pumps people begin to watch sc for similar moves and enter early  will likely follow but not ready yet observing  isnt life just a long long dream after all  ltc looks promising but no usable pattern yet however if btc breaks out to the upside ltc will one of the few following  only the beginning  doge is a nobrainer will have its time longterm perspective dgb weekly all requirements given  trendline break  volume increase  supportive emas  higher low  higher high   conserative entry trigger 295 target 1   sc will likely follow at some point doesnt seem completely ready yet observing  vet way too far advanced from a chaperspective to trigger my interest update  update  dgb continuing to surge after consolidation takeout of 256 highs should lead to much anticipated acceleration  make peace with change it is the only thing in life that will always remain constant btc bear case in question as three attempts to drive down price failed back to trendline amp ema bundle needs violent breakdown from here to revalidate the case 9300 high is bears last stand    update  btc trendline retest completed if bear case is valid break down should follow on volume sweeping lows and forcing bulls out of positions   trolling permitted for 16ers  retest of trendline always legal however two failed attempts to break down occured prior observing closely btc retesting trendline and ema bundle from below decisive moment  i guess it is needless to say that in money printing wonderland everything goes taking the chaas it is i would expect this structure to break down however always have in mind money printers can go a long long way  looks to me like a failed hamps for the time being break above 256 double top would accelerate the trend uncertain how dgb would react to a sudden btc move though  legacy markets recjected at breakout point resistance breakdown from these levels would be most logical trendline broken amp retested in lower timeframes expecting btc to follow   possibly a potential scenario outlined in last repo btc recent structure seems to have failed hamps in the process of developing right shoulder approaching neckline 9000 key level to hold to avoid potential selloff   never gone at least mentally enjoyed two weeks of deep meditation  just published a piece on the current situation in btc and its potential implications   this last month i asked 33 different crypto founders investors thought leaders analysts content creators and develope  sure last repofor the next two to three weeks as i am having an internet gap due to me moving enjoy the read and happy halving to everyone    pullback or pushthrough  btc managed to break out and reached upper channel boundary at 8400 as indicated in previous repoin the meanwhile dominance is rising again alts temporarily suffering if btc trend does not pause here i would expect the next resistance to be around 9500ish  i think i have seen this one before ltc  mana triggered as outlined in previous repowaiting for the other setups to complete   if you missed it reread here     thanks for the suppoand the suggestion added a dgb address to the suppopage   dgb dkd414msceuace5ljeaxvbhbw1t6jwm34t  again thanks for letting me know you appreciate my work new repopublished analyzing the current condition of btc amp the altcoin market and outlining the opportunities currently presented   its time to enjoy the early phase of the trend emerging and to let it roll prices denominated in the exchanges valuation of the chadisplayed trigger prices would be different at poloniex or other no matter the valuation upper boundary needs to be broken to be a valid entry long more detailed look in h4 upper boundary must be broken  xmr is presenting a similar outlook as btc albeit a more powerful pattern looks like a cup amp handle in h4 looking to break out to the upside 00081500008163 would be a trigger long when taken out curious whether this one has the power to surge here  congratulations to all who bought dgb in the last days amp weeks volume is impressive and indicates followup  dgb is a buy around 116 and below trendline broken strong weekly entry bar after higher low higher high trend reversal  if you enjoyed watching the usoil show wait til you see its repercussions  it is not being ignored people read what you put out there continue your good work and dont let your light be dampened just because people cant see what you can see you pursue activism and finding the truth not because it is pleasant but because it is right for you to do  tell me more about the dark side didnt i find this one in decentralands last tweets nothing to see here right  you cant possibly be serious mingling with bill gates is the path to the dark side   nonetheless breakouts occuring through failed rising wedge structures tend to be very explosive i see spx and btc intertwined for the time being further economy shocks might drag down btc with it halving will have its effect supply shock is coming and will manifest in price  the correlation cannot be ignored spx is basically in the same process as is btc trading in resistance in a rising wedge kind of structure solely from the chawould expect a dump and downtrend continuation but this is the stock market and money printing can go a long way  the normal order of things  assuming the btc downtrend is still intact  would be a breakdown of this corrective move in order to resume the trend down however this has not happened and it must be questioned whether or not it will  read more  the phaneron   a cosmology thread   props

are doing you will find a way through and if you dont maybe there is another path waiting for you out there published a new letter on  analyzing current btc market structure and sharing my thoughts subscribe to receive mails w notifications after two years of silence i just published my latest article the great silence discussing the global financial situation the implications of a spreading pandemic and what the future may hold for us as a global civilization let me know your thoughts  the global economic system is not and never was designed to withstand a complete halt of the gear wheel it either keeps going and keeps going perpetually faster or the music stops playing with the continuation of the global financial meltdown in traditional markets the demand for independent storeofvalue systems will become apparent rather sooner than later while the safehaven narrative for precious metals and crypto appears to be invalid for the time being this will not remain so for long this line better holds   indeed will venture a lot more into writing articles and other valuable content in the future still preparing the ground so the seeds will grow and sprout nicely when time is right didnt like the rejection of the initial breakout didnt like the second rejectionfailed breakout above 9200 i remain cautious about the possibility for a potential breakdown below the 8400 lows waiting for more information as often with early entries patience is tested by another shakeout before resuming in the direction indicated correct stoploss for a swing trade would be 8680 timing could have been better but still happy with a 8600ish entry after all recovery seemingly successful highs taken out bulls in control for the time being  hard rejection on the 1h chaneeds immediate recovery otherwise i would be very concerned about btc for the time being initial breakout was good however needs to take out 8822 local high for a successful higher lowhigher high trend reversal thereby becoming a serious breakout attempt btc bears seem to be losing momentum potential early entry long    you certainly got a point there   concerning this fractal would argue we have already seen that down move and would move up higher after a another small correction    using this one same data but a visualization map   it is time nan   will be leaving this space for a while remaining fully invested perspective hasnt changed  still in the first selloff on a major timescale still the beginning 50k inevitable global fomo will reignite if it drops again buy more may the patience be with you farewell i would rather not like to see mankind go on for another lap in this vicious cycle yet only a critical mass of awakened individuals and their respective actions will have the power to break it so that humanity  at last  may be free again resist no matter how sinister the plan it always will need your individual consent it is our choices that shape this space and our acceptance of responsibility for this choice that decides the eventual fate understand that once a system is established on a global scale under centralized control your every step will be monitored while your data will be fed into a system which knows no escape by the time you realize it it is already too late to act no matter if we believe satoshis intention was pure or not there is a battle going on to gain control of the system at this time to make transactions trackable while denying options that strengthens anonymity the ones striving for this control do not work in your interest in many respects mankind is on the bring of revolution and it is our individual choices that pave the way from here thus altering the future we someday will live in crypto will either be used to free  or to bind them all at this time though it increasingly looks like crypto might become mankinds worst nightmare if we do not change our ways just like the force technology can be used for both good and bad depending on the primary intention of those controlling it when i first got interested in cryptocurrency i saw it as a tremendous opportunity for mankind to free itself from the global debtbased fiat slave system by giving back the power over money from the banks to the individual if we continue using centralized exchanges as a gateway to swap coins while providing kyc  it completely misses the point of cryptocurrency  only when nonkyc nonlimit decentralized exchanges take over predominant market volume the real cryptocurrency revolution may begin  thanks for the shoutout cant find value in ur posts either   when using prices comments always referenced to the chartexchange used in the cha   good morning   if i would trade the 3d chai would place my buy stop at one tick above that 4384 high so i will get into position with the breakout correct sl would be 3200 conseratively or 3600 at last low 4100 high taken out offering a trade opportunity for higher timeframe traders with a long entry at conserative trigger 4385 which would complete the ihamps expecting both volume amp volatility  daily candle about to close strong daily volume downtrend broken sometimes what you see is what you get and what i yesterdays high has been triggered next logical step in this play would be the takeout of prior local high above 4100 accompanied by significant volume surge see obv below sending us towards critical high of 4384 failure in doing so would result in more retesting  btc w signs of potential early trend reversal adding long positions with a breakout above yesterdays daily candle in anticipation of strong upside move into key resistance above risking the earlier entry here in favor of better riskreward ratio  spx in trouble   thanks mate its tough to be honest and i have thought countless times about leaving this space for good and let everyone stew in their own juice anyway this is a marathon and i know there are some who appreciate my thoughts so i just keep on despite neg amp no compensation a new public crypto and bitcoin repowas published to bitcoin live  the state of bitcoin my approach to buying the at least something is about to reach ath   highly unlikely always said no financial advice just displaying my thoughts  expecting it to turn out rather quickly rather hours and days than weeks or months  thats the spirit wish you the best of success my friend  same told friends and family at 250 this is the time told them again at 1k only few listened and nobody at 200ish but yeah thats how it usually goes important is only that they find an entrance into this game so they will be well off in the future  i sincerely apologize to those ending up buying high in pabc of my perspective earlier this year however by all means this does not free you from the responsibility to make your own informed decisions i have faith it will turn out very well for all of us if we endure   neither quick article on what we might expect in the coming days  stay faithful my friends   if you experiment a lot you will fail often but at the same time your odds of success will also increase  success and  got suspended follow his new account   satoshi created a system that would not allow anyone to prohibit a transaction to another peer yet here you are advocating the implementation of a middle men being in the position of disallowing particular transactions because of reason  and freedom is jeopardized  again    who cares bitcoin is supposed to be a currency without central control prohibiting exactly that us sanctioning bitcoin adresses coinbase connects accounts to paypal satoshi would turn in his grave  i could also pretend to be super confident but i am not go make your own decisions signal triggered needs confirmation above 4268 finex for potential escalation however i am not certain about the outcome of this pattern so take it with a grain of caution do what you gotta do setup irrelevant if not triggered gt4233 finex bears have failed to drive down the price at the lows printed a clear double bottom instead observing if and how this signal is being triggered then reevaluate     thanks for the interesting discussion    agreed putting humans on pedestal is not the way to go we have a lot in common with animals yet never mastered to live in harmony with them i am just saying animals are a soul in a body too just like you and me just different levels of perception   a portion of the universal force which has voluntarily split itself off to experience itself from a different angleduality   being a mammal with arms and legs would indicate you must be the body yet if you just breath and relax your body and your mind begins to chatter who is the mind is it you then again if you just observe your mind talking who is the observer now if you have the ability to perceive yourself who exactly is you   if you have the ability to perceive yourself who exactly is you   thats the real question is consciousness something biological or does it operate independently from the bodys biological processes if it is independent from these bodily functions it could as well change bodies or travel outside the body ie astral projection  besides i agree it is not the planet that is problematic it is only humans that are flawed i do believe life is all about the illusion that we are in fact infinite which means your consciousness is the same always just in different bodies over time yet we pretend to be not  sure your parents would not know whether or not you have existed prior because they are only involved in the biological reproduction process bodydna which has nothing to do with the soul the soul comes into the body when it is ready which neither you nor parents remember  dude you got some research to do if you really think thats how you ended up on this shit planet  soon but not yet   my bet is on fakeout zoomed in to better visualize huge wicks on top no dominant buy volume if this becomes a strong move i would be surprised but crypto has fooled us before so patiently waiting for more information   how do you know you didnt exist before you were born couldnt it be you just forgot just like when you awake from a dream at night but cant remember in the morning  isnt end is just a different word for beginning imagine thinking you have a body with an inherent soul instead of being an infinite soul in a temporary body        gtimagine getting a 12 annual wage increase in the same currency which depreciates by 250 every single year  and call it a win  imagine taking such house loan on flexible interest rates which inevitably will rise so you will end up paying more and more over time  what do you think jeff way more interesting great work in the last months by the way have enjoyed your tweets a lot   completely agree sometimes we find ourselves in situations and dont fully understand how we got there but then it is our responsibility to make the best out of it paying down the house as quickly as possible as you said while accumulating metal would be my way in your case    i agree it is an investment with value  when you have completed the payback before that its the bank who actually owns your house while you live in it until it is paid off  and beware if you cannot pay your share  you might be one of those who construct a house on quicksand then   technically in that case you would make a loss  i agree however you are not bonded by a decade long contract but can cancel a flathouse rather quickly i imagine it to be tough in such expensive areas though would focus on making money early in life so you can free yourself   earn it then spend it accumulate real currency property gold and silver  at what time in history has it ever been wise to spend money you dont actually have money gotta come from somewhere and it aint free people will realize it sooner or later  tweet of the day imagine having a choice  well dunno about you but i rather take a temporary 85 paper loss which will be irrelevant in the future than realizing at some stage in my life that all i saved is gone imagine taking a loan to buy a house amp end up paying off that loan  interest for decades while they just press a button on a computer to generate the money lol  humans crack me up imagine being trapped in a currency which depreciates by 250 every single year because you dont really understand what fiat money really is  imagine building a life not understanding the underlying economic principles the world is running on ever built a house on quicksand   checking marketplace regularly kinda like a browser game ocassionally buyingselling rn there are some interesting parcels i am watching but no chance to contact sellers im sure they wanna get rid of them by the looks while i wanna have them slightly cheaper so patience  when messaging feature to negotiate marketplace deals would make land trading way more efficient   i have some buy orders laddered between 2800  3100 will add more with bullish price action  strength if 3k bounce is too weak or not convincing i will quickly close and put buys around 12001000 nyse and nasdaq both planning new bitcoin investment products for q1 of 2019 and market sentiment is crying about bitcoi  ie in highly volatile action bitmex is unable to handle transactions which means you might not get orders in for minutes neither opening nor closing positions while price jumps up and down on insane volume hence be prepared this might happen adjust strategy accordingly  last breaths of the bear currently imho as said quick capitulation then hefty rebounce days to weeks nothing would make me happier to see a strong bull spike but price action indicates otherwise i do agree on the shortterm negative price implications however i do not believe in the prolonged crypto winter narrative violent capitulation then mass sholiquidations  fomo  definitely the opportunity of a lifetime imho all the best of luck friend  dont sell all your silver though you might need it sooner than you think   mostly laddering 28003100 some around 1100 just in case that being said probability of stopping at 3k zone is significantly higher than 1k but both targets in the range of possibility  said i will leave it until end of year no matter what commentresumediscussion afterwards price action not convincing imho expecting capitulation soon will be quick amp violent ur favorite engine might not be able to handle the volatility  plan ahead strong suppoaround 28003000 if 3k suppofails it wont stop before 10001200 be prepared almost there   you are aware that this trade never got activated as the daily bar didnt get triggered  stop order at one tick above risk of gliding through 4500 amp liquidating bears is too high waiting for a close could end up very expensive in that case i am a buyer should this daily bar get triggered will wait for more information if doesnt  picked up some etc zec mana and zen today  when a body is already lethally ill does it matter which sickness eventually kills it if you run a business and make 5 per year you gonna have a bad bad time especially when your debt increases exponentially because you cannot repay it   sure i meant solely to live on it instead of paying rent in a collapsing economy   china russia iran  they all try to avoid the usd in oil transactions working on alternative systems for years now while at the same time stocking up massively on gold they know what is coming   silver gold crypto own property books skills spend time researching and prepare for such scenarios no matter how likely they will be especially when you live in the us directly if the collapse begins you are either prepared or not but time is running out imho     unfortunately you will be among the first when this everything bubble comes down though usd is the world currency and it has no value whatsoever   debttogdp ratio of the top debt burdened countries  as usually truth slams harder than anything  and quicker  wait there is more   we already know the economic system isnt sustainable right now its just humans pretending this isnt the case the money needed to repay debts simply does not exist and never will  go back to sleep then its all fine  btc is entering the stage of its life cycle when stale and weak money capitulates and strong hands accumulate strategica this is the the moment everyone who believed is now doubting it all one by one they fall away like raindrops in the stor    currently trading below weekly ema 200 which is around 4200ish   open etf at top shothe market heavily open bakkt rebuy everything at a 90 discount cruel but genius                       1089 is the old ath in my books depends on exchanges though retesting that low would be savage 3k more likely imho but if it hits 1k thats a nobrainer for me imagine the salt levels down there lol  perfectly alright with me mate my strategy was never about selling the top of this rally but next i have time if i set a longterm strategy no way i depabecause of price fluctuations the value of the lessons learned is priceless crypto will be back stronger than ever  it is alright to look back for reflection crucial even but then move on i agree  sure cold storage as said nothing has ever taught me more about trading and myself than this market cycle however if you are waiting for me to capitulate i hope you got plenty of patience because it aint happening  i am bullish longterm shortterm i am waiting for proper capitulation to 3k or 1k looking at suppoof previous highs around 3000 which would make it an additional drop of 50 from 6000 key level   remember 6666 level that was tested countless times in earlier years range  3333 would be 50 of that eyeing both levels looks like proper capitulation now   what a fallacy to believe there will be any gold and silver available when real crisis hits high triggered without significant breakout nor followup buying no volume no convincing price action needs more retesting first solid higher low after prolonged selloff amp trendline break might generate some traction needs gt 4500 breakout finex on volume  if not triggered more retesting incoming downtrend still active needs strong breakout to flip the board   quite frankly the double top doesnt concern me what does is two occasions of trading in overbought  pending trendline break closing below red low would make every trader who was a buyer in 2018 holding a losing position meanwhile in the us close below red would be devastating for the global economy       great care we must take sell bitcoin for death star you must not    well without a doubt crypto will be second after metals which wont be available days after the real collapse starts when every traditional asset stocks bonds etc say goodbye options to preserve capital will be rare some might say fiat but they dont understand inflation   realistic is that this system solely operates on debt which cannot be repaid realistic is that the federal reserve is a private organization realistic is as well that banks use ur hard earned moneyinsuranceretirement money to gamble on the markets on insane leverage facts    in hindsight 08 will look like the test dump before the actual meltdown tiny in comparison   you might talk about a recession i am talking about the end of the global traditional system as we know it having said that gold and silver will definitely not be available to the general public so the question remains if not crypto wheres the money going  in that case where will the money flow when gold and silver is no longer available to purchase money gotta flow somewhere the upside of down crypto markets everyone just earned another bear badge and many newbs just morphed into veterans h nan   old dino yells at crowd   bought 250 area really dont care about shortterm price swings interesting  is today the day whats next if the the breakdown in btcusd is going to prove to be a spring we need to see a rally back into the trading range soon     understood you are familiar with the matter just in case somebody wanted  to know more      actually quite an interesting phenomenon   the concept of multiple discovery is the hypothesis that most scientific discoveries and inventions are made independently and more or less simultaneously by multiple scientists and inventors  also see list    common phenomena  can tell collective consciousness is something  link to article   not looking for fundamental catalyst it depends on big buyers at this level to initiate spring if such things is in the book at all i do not want to see 1k neither do i think it is particularly likely at this stage without further lls  discussed a bear scenario in my article back in may which indicates 1k retest incoming if 6k suppois successfully broken without such strong comeback described above for now it is a break below but whether it holds below 6k is yet to be seen definitely bulls turn now btc bulls trading in defense after recent drop below key supponow need a powerful comeback to initiate spring as last resofurther lower lows without violent comeback would indicate prolonged bear market  likewise failure in printing new lows will attract buyers  nice try  get free stellar xlm for a free dox 1 no one should use  since it has the most

incredibly bullish  nan breakin attempted at assanges residence in ecuador embassy    it is a descending triangle the probability of a downside breakout is greater but not definitive a descending triangle breaking to the upside would fool most traders  needless to say the acion generated by a bullish resolution of this bearish pattern would escalate  i can imagine both rising at the same time while bitcoin outperforming gold on a larger scale i think btcgold will continue to have relevance for the future if we look at where the 2013 bubble topped out right at parity w gold  steady suppoof five ounces gold per bitcoin assuming bitcoin is digital gold this chashould have significant relevance  nan some btc observations  1 trendline broken amp currently being retested 2 total mktcap

tho    nan we have reached a critical juncture in human history and everything is about to change i would encourage you to be a light in the darkness because that is going to be greatly needed in the days ahead     initially the plan was to enter at breakout suppoaround 6400ish still a very risky trade imho as really anything can happen here nonetheless it is the scenario i waited for so even if its risky worth the shot   in cold storage as it should be not intending to sell any opened another btc long feeling like a maniac though  dont try this at home crypto is replacing fiat at an

this either last time us wall st 30 traded above the upwards channel it went into rapid decline same fractal applied to current situation would indicate dump has only just begun if history repeats itself watching this chaclosely   i do hope it is but if we get both today in a turbulent manner this hope might diminish rather quickly im alright with stock market meltdown and btc spike on the same day  but must not be on 101018   a market so manipulated not sure what you expect i am saying have some silver have some gold be safe turbulent times ahead german economy under decent pressure as hamps top pattern manifests in weekly chadax   record low volatility for days nobody really trading then when finally something happens everyone in this space tries to log in at the same time typical bottleneck failure final structure btc  expect insane volatility in the coming days  nan curious about what decentraland will turn into shill me your land below open interest gt 24h volume  btc taking capitulate them by playing dead way too literally todays intraday range is a  dump stopped in triangle suppoexpanding triangle indicates trend reversal after consolidation trendline broken price currently in the last leg of this correction weak channel weak bearish trend likely going to form another hl thus upside channel break is an entry long   using bittrex poloniex  zcl fractaling while trading in previous breakout suppo  i see what you mean then still buying around here would make the position very safe in the case of this cup n handle event taking place in the same context dgb with an early entry setup as sellers seemingly become exhausted these are the kinds of setups i am looking for very early relatively high risk yet very safe position for the long run if setup is successful as before target 1   these days are coming again greener than ever before the first selloff  interesting view so in case that this cup amp handle is indeed a reality one would favor to buy early to survive a retest of the cup which would likely retest the exact entry level if that is whats going to happen this would be a great spot to increase initial position   yeşil mumlar ve ben buradayım sonuçta yoda yeşil hatırladın mı  thats the narrative until now fact is that 6k suppohas held strong after that 58 wick and got retested many times thereby printing higher lows however if 6k suppobreaks we likely see a violent capitulation wick agree  xbtusd bitmex early entry long would be triggered above 6830 which is the confirmation we need to justify for the higher risk in this trade setup is in 3d chaas the bullish outside bar is already triggered buying earlier in lower timeframes is possible but way more risky would wait  worst case really is this setup failing and getting a capitulation wick under 6  58 instead not really seeing this happening right now bulls are in control at this stage imho takes some time to manifest in the chart  pretty much same if btc goes ltc will follow i always have both charts open considering this position to be safe sl can be raised to last low to protect gains  reduce risk would let it run excellent longterm investment   i did delete them deliberately as my theory has proven to be invalid tweets did not get censored the  in the beginning of the tweet was the reason why it was not published as a regular tweet early entry long btc in anticipation of trendline break and leaving 6k area for good as suppohas proven to be respected two higher lows proximity of important trendline and triggered bullish outside bar in favor of positive advance risky trade as early worth the risk imo   es lag scheinbar nicht an den hashtags sondern dass  rwe_ag zu beginn des posts stand was es dann zu einer nachricht macht statt eines regulären

fails everyone who shorted in the double top structure will be stopped out one tick above the double top high further helping to increase price flat traders could see it as a double top failure entry long  break above 7426 would make it a higher high but thats almost 1000 distance from here my intention is to enter early in anticipation of that happening instead of waiting for such expensive confirmation  sure i can include everything i see in the chabut for an outside viewer it would be very messy and unclear instead i tend to include only what i want to point out at this specific moment anyone who has eyes can see that the highs are lower than the previous yet adding to my longterm btc position with breakout above 6840 double top trigger two higher lows in buy area between ema 100200 and bullish price action after trendline break at this level further strengthens my positive outlook for the remainder of the year  update btc quick dip into target zone reversed back up quickly many bears trapped this should get interesting  another retest of previous highs around 65006600 area is possible which would be my target area for longer term longs this might be a very undervalued signal yet so important in this phase people might look back to this setup one day saying this is where the bull run started hashrate continuously rising market sentiment devastated 71 drop from ath bullish

possible     nan  spare me with the gender bs we are all one in different disguise it is no question of who is better or running the world instead it is about perpetual balance between men and female energies   same with the previous crowd on ct doesnt change the fact that some of these ladies will transform into trading beasts imho  i hoped it would not go into such direction but well this is a twoway beneficial development imho females were a pretty rare phenomenon in this space before while they can learn from us we can certainly learn from them which results in learning for all  that means if you are open to it 2018  the year when the ladies overtook ct  i do appreciate female input as it provides a fresh and alternative perspective to the market as well as introducing a completely new mindset to the game in general keep it up ladies that one time when  lost 50 against cryptoyoda what did i just read lol   did anyone come up with a bitmex tick chayet 4h btc  all

valuable in the beginning a joy only german speakers may experience challenge yourself    among the most difficult things in trading   never reported on nano however had a look doesnt look too shabby trendline broken volume significantly increasing exactly as you want to see around bottom should be a gainer purely technical   neither i am watching the price action unfold and sell either when it goes full parabolic mode or when it breaks the parabola im more flexible in my selling while my buying is based on strict rules in this case my rough target is 1 so any weakness in this territory gt tp update dgb triggered amp active   i agree though a potential takeout of 8500 increases the likelihood of 10k being taken out as well  tried several different ema values over the time ema 20 100 and 200 is the combination that yields best results over the long run very steady almost always respected in some form or another ema 50 is believed to be great as well but its somehow included in my 20100200 set great addition ema 20 or 21 in that case is respected on several candles indicating the run has not ended but merely corrected   thats correct close above august candle 7760 would put pressure on bears already potentially long already entering in anticipation of 8500 take out so as long as the lows are not taken out it is considered to be bullish little comment on the monthly close   bulls have gained control in the previous candle the august candle attempted to retest the lows of previous bar but failed instead generated a higher low large tail below indicates buying pressure close above 8500 would be very bullish  monthly and 3d bar closing in 5 mins btc  i remember when i posted a chato buy at 1520 sats and nobody could understand why in the world anybody would buy doge

doing ta on shorts and longs they said it works though   thanks mate twitter said error so i just clicked again   i love it when people share charts and provide some perspective or thought has decreased unfortunately keep it up smawould probably be waiting for the setup to be triggered in dgbusd and then enter in dgbbtc but thats just how i would do it if i would be looking for a time advantage with increased probability of success   another perspective dgbusd will likely be the reason for the setup in dgbbtc to be triggered respected trendline higher low trendlines breaks slowly advancing volume looks excellent to me as an entry long    bounced up from oversold territory and printed a higher low several trendlines broken buyers will now try and retest last high if bears are unable to defend that level this is an entry long but 437 needs to be triggered reasons enough to go long here as well just riskier   agreed feels just the same  not selling before a dollar ltc with a similar setup as dgb higher low reversal in breakout point suppoon daily chaentering with break of 62 high in anticipation of trendline break  dgbbtc with a higher low buy setup on daily chaafter

begin but may take years or decades to bloom    well put sometimes agreeing to disagree is the wisest thing we can do different opinions are paof the game no reason for anyone to be salty about others not seeing their point of view nonetheless i do wish you best of success on your path to take   you should not get liquidated in the first place by not being tempted to margin trade especially if you have not a proven trackrecord of successful trading for years in such environment be safe buy amp store safely and hold until adopted globally   in january we discussed indepth about various misinformation and such wont open that topic again now my standpoint wont change i have seen enough chapter xrp indefinitely closed for a variety of reasons at least in my personal investment strategy likewise do as you please   wrote a detailed article about it on my blog in early january feel free to have a read    presumably there is nothing further away from the force than xrp learn to recognize the dark side you must so you are telling me you ended up shorting the greatest invention since the internet and got liquidated with your entire net worth while in truth you knew crypto would conquer the world in storm and now you look back and wish you would just have bought and held update mktcap dominance  successfully retested 50 area however seems to be struggling to print a higher high in the chalower high in this case would mean breakthrough lt50 increases in likelihood closing below 50 will make this move a failed breakout hence altseason   addition ltcbtc shows an extended leg down on very low volume indicating that this is solely a corrective move while breakout point of previous rally is being retested clearly in oversold territory obv shows majority of buyers havent sold anticipating higher prices  ltc point of maximum financial opportunity in sight  retested previous structure ema 200 acting as additional suppostochrsi flatlined and ready to go while volume is steadily declining waiting for a move cant see much more downside happening here  bitmexmaintenance    def an advantage compared to those who have no crypto at all cant argue with that   we are all together in an insane pit here should place emphasis on collaboration after all we do not know anything at all before it happens can only try our best    only provided there is an infrastructure in place to actively trade these crypto assets for real life goods like foodmedicine if hyperinflation comes to your country before that happens you would might need additional preparation for going through these difficult times  beginning point would be informing what happens to a currency that goes into hyperinflation by now there are plenty of ressources available to research which will inevitably bring you to how you prepare for such but first hurdle is always to be willing to deal with such matters being prepared is being responsible   there is no need to get offensive a heavy shosqueeze might be the definite trigger of such bull run happening the squeeze wouldnt be the effect just the initial cause we may agree to disagree however wont change the fact that this remains a possibility imagine this happening to your local currency and ask yourself honestly and with integrity am i prepared   will stay pinned for the remainder of 2018 even if ending up wrong i tend to be right on price but distorted on time i do have faith  three months is an eternity in this space and any major shosqueeze on massive volume in this territory will bring us back to ath in no time   true feels like ages ago lol  implemented that line for the fun would bring us into 3500  4000 area however the fact that the green line got retested and respected on several occasions might indicate it actually has value whereas orange line seems hypothetical for as long as green is valid   the program you mean metatrader 4 fxopen ecn mt4 is what i learned trading with in forex fxopen seems to offer both btc and ltc charts on their platform i like to use several programs as well exactly for the purpose as described  finding old taanalysis and see if its valid  undervalued followed tfw you open an old trading program and an ancient trendline you placed months ago is surprisingly accurate amp respected  rekt just before the  2015   this tweet aged well

expecting turbulent moves as soon as one of them folds almost there  i heard someone is working on a best of crypto tweets book  check out my collection  and pls share da alltime best  with such distant sl definitely a runner however depending on the strength and volume of the breakout i might close the position temporarily just to reenter at another retest of my entry point emas generally beginning to be compressed in timeframes h1 and below signaling explosive move in the making in either direction will be entering a btc long with 6626 break sl placed below 6k suppoaround 5800 below low of the weekly candle anticipating higher low reversal and rejection at ema 100 in weekly ema 200 in 3d if 6626 does not get triggered no position will be entered   it is certainly looked at by many traders mktcap always was one of the best indications for altseason or contracting market 50 is the important halfway mark and should be respected can be likened to the xbtxau chawhich seems to respect the 5oz mark undervalued data imho  percentage of total mktcap peaked around 54 currently retesting key area of 50 this will either result in an uptrend confirmation btc dominating above 54 or in a failed breakout with a close below 50 alts dominating  in the darkened night the most valuable seed will be planted appreciate dark times for without them bright days have no meaning  this too shall pass btc w two dojis in proximity of ema200 which is both a trading range amp an expanding triangle in lower timeframes it is also a 2nd retest of both ema200 and 6000 suppoon slightly rising volume indicating sellers seem to be exhausted while buyers begin to be more confident  the 7x bump in hash rate since last year doesnt get enough attention look at that chainsane   bulls will put pressure on the bears to close their positions which would drive the price up and liquidate more bears on the run up bears on the other hand will attempt to defend their positions at all costs bears groins in a bag the interesting question now is will that bag get squeezed  hmmmm  it is said that the darkest hour of the night comes just before the dawn are we witnessing capitulation right here    as long as people have still trust in fiatusd the mindset remains usd value obsession is temporary and will change in due time the system is falling one domino at a time store your crypto cold amp metals safe be prepared trust me buy crypto and gold your usd will become worthless with us economic collapse all old money currencies will crash    thanks for that shoutout love your calm style not to mention the smooth sound keep it up  want to know why the usa will eventually be stripped as the reserve currency of the world   just take a look at this on top of that we are currently in an extended leg downwards and facing 6k suppoafter going a very long way already i doubt bears have enough strength left to drive it below but thats only my 2 cents amp i might err decision time soon imho brave yourselves either way  we have not managed to close below 6k which indicates strength of suppofor now i would agree on the bearish outlook if we take out this suppoand sailclose below 5700 but at this time we are trading in suppoand any turnaround would mean a higher low in daily chart sentiment sufficiently bearish for a major bounce when everybody agrees we are going way lower and tweets with somewhat bullish outlook gets ridiculed amp flamed it might be time to be very attentive to the actual movements in the market btc dominance now 505  market nearing decisiontime might take some days to play out   hamps structure was likely to be retested this is no different than a triangle structure getting retested before resuming up later the triangle in that case isnt dead it is still in the chaand acts as a magnetsuppodifference is just in the case of btc suppobroke    contrary to most investors being here today i manifactured my strategy more than 4 years ago amp i knew exactly what to expect in terms of manipulation and institutional money early entry now gives me great freedom in how i react to the market best choice usually is to do nothing   fine with me strategy has been set and will be executed exactly as planned as long as critcial variables dont change at this state i view recent action as a big shakeout before resumption and all the bearishness on ct couldnt convince me otherwise   true wont delete though wrong on the setup still bullish overall what matters is a higher low on the daily so above 5700ish  the zone becomes resistance instead further increasing selling pressure prices would then likely attempt to take out 5755 and generate a lower low  if suppoholds it will generate another higher low on the daily chaadding buying pressure in the coming weeks after recent structure broke downwards btc is still trading in ihamps suppocritical zone for bulls to hold opportunity if reverses up from there   same either way could go all the way up to 50k and people would still flame my tweets in fact the very best amp earliest calls have a cascade of negative comments underneath im overall bullish on crypto and will stay until otherwise deal with it  would argue that prices attempted to retest 6800 several times with another failed breakout below suppoto 6847 sufficient for me as a retest the fact that we left open a gap might be bullish as long as we hold above 6847 buying pressure will prevail imho btc shooting out of oversold area after retesting 6800 suppobullish  zcl popping  btc weekly update  absolutely gorgeous close a trifecta of a monthly weekly and daily retest hopped into another lon  can as well use daily chashowing a successful retest of previous high suppoas i expect the 6800 suppoto hold longing here at first sign of weakness by bears like a double doji exhaustion in suppomight be very profitable albeit risky  btc oversold in suppoam long in speculation of bullish break      just what i think is most likely  nan etc working on it  zcl is your time     things  posts might seem weird if you didnt dive into the rabbit hole problem is though he is right on many things very woke better be open minded    that red line lol eth   im operating on cycles the one you mentioned is called salt st cheat sheet  definitely oversold leg question is how deep bears can push before this leg turns up again pattern is three touches of the trendline failed breakout below then sharp upside reversal observing  anything between 7000 and 6500 is considered suppoand retest of ihamps structure trading below 6500 would put pressure on bulls careful then however expecting the structure suppoto hold which would print the third higher low on the chaimho this is disbelief dip  btc attempting to retest ihamps suppoaround 6800 as shortterm suppohas failed to hold  in case you were looking for another counterindicator   agreed definitely a possibility one more big flush as you said would have many solid holders tumbling and sell at bottom historically almost all rallies have begun by some form of a bear trap so thats not entirely out of the books  i only assumed this was what you described now it is clear you are right on that we printed higher low and higher high however it must not always lead to a reversal failed breakout above the high following a sharp downside reversal is possible and 50 is quite a resistance  adding thoughts to your charts would make it more valuable otherwise it is just a neutral drawing   talking major resistance at previous lows i suppose possible   measured move would point btc percentage to the range 5052 where i expect a reversal so money may flow back into alts once again imho we will see another major altseason and everybody will forget that btc was once king that is when btc will come back and alts will be wiped   retest of ihamps suppoaround 6800 definitely remains a possibility problem is that with such retest we would close below meme triangle once again potentially making this a failed breakout in that case battle of 6800 will be critical   my theory is that we will retest 50 btc dominance which is currently attempted before altseason may stadominance now 484  looking for any reversal patterns in this range for those who dont see the value of btc dominance chaignore nothing to see here  another chapter tales of the btc meme triangle  prices currently retesting tip of triangle is that the disbelief dip  if trend is genuinely up supposhould hold around here    btc    price action definitely more effective in higher timeframes never understood why al is trading only very small timeframes the profit could be way higher would he trade bigger tfs but well every trader has his style trading price action on daily charts is the charm for me  never too late especially if you are already trading for a prolonged time i believe there is much value and understanding to be extracted from these books very welcome and best of success  as my first read was a german beginner book which has not been translated i cannot suggest such a book in english you must find one yourself i can however recommend these books  technical analysis by murphy advanced reading price charts bar by bar by al brooks master  using ema 20 100 200 in this case the ema cluster would be 20 and 100 acting as shortterm support  books to stawith would be any beginner book understand the very basics of how the market works first then dive deeper into technical analysis if you have done that and traded much to convetheories into understanding go ahead amp dive into price actionpsychology  as recent price action is downwards the tweet indicates that prices might bounce at either of the two green zones best suggestion for everyone interested in learning is read books trade read another book trade  theory amp practice  balanced learning two levels of suppobtc  percentage of total mktcap dominance approaching resistance level of 50 which is also the target of the measured move up key level to watch    simply not buying or changing to shops that can satisfy my needs as a crypto customer most certainly not opening up a 3rd party wallet just to

lowshighs with further confirmation needed above 6834 for the mtr to be successful bullish  for everyone who made a decision to involve their time and money in cryptocurrency  what an act of faith   i applaud yo longerterm view btc remains in buy zone on 3d chawith strong suppoat ema 200 on which price got rejected thrice while still being in a longerterm uptrend the zone between ema 100 and 200 remains buy zone falling wedge almost completed now ihamps move in the making     at least he is meditating   agreed watching it closely for a strong spike soonish dgbusd chashows there is plenty of room left   viewed from a macro perspective   i come from a place where i started with nothing and worked my way up by hard work and much suffering i understand many are in a similar position these days thus focus work on strengthen yourself because imho where you are in life is 100 mindsetattitude life is the game   i am fine with agreeing to disagree my friend was not meant as offensive as it sounded gotta admit this crowd is testing my equanimity these days all the best to you too  so a game is defined as something that does not involve money please think about stuff before triggering me in a discussion which has no base  what is the fundamental difference between a game and trading there is none except trading is the biggest and most popular game in the world  simple ifthen construct  if lt6423 then retest of 6k amp trendline if gt6642 then liquidation of bears target 7k ish bull trend activated  sideways possible for some duration the longer the more explosive resolution of pattern  hypothesis is that we are currently building bottom formation in btc further confirmed by the toxic sentiment bullish engulfing in daily chajune 29 was the first indication trendline break was the second 6848 high needs to be taken out to confirm major trend reversal quality of comments reaching all time lows if you cannot extract value of a simple pattern observation described with potential targets for both scenarios outlined you cant be helped in this game addition from a higher perspective  bearish resolution would lead to more retesting of trendlineprevious lows around 6k  bullish resolution would stop out bearish traders anticipating a continuation of bear trend  two shortterm btc scenarios hamps completion vs hamps failure     generating a bear trap to spike followers thats a whole new level   dgb mana etc   except it is not  weekly obv divergence is impressive    1 then reevaluate  talk to ya in a year shall we if i find the time laters i might discuss these and other charts more elaborately  in the bag patiently waiting  i have some more although these here are among the most promising with both ltc and dgb being main positions longterm bargains chartwise ltc dgb zec doge mana etc zcl  undervalued area with much potential for upside for the rest of 2018 and beyond for the record current valuation  ltc 84 dgb 0026 zec 183 doge 0002 mana 0093 etc 1668 zcl 796  just my 2 cts ltc litecoin bullish break of 84347   i sincerely hope never regards  btc daily trendline broken now waiting for volume  btc triggered on volume confirming trendline break further indicating buying pressure will likely prevail according to uptrend definition  depends on where you see the supres line your line indicates 6425 as the key level which is true to some degree but we have several suppoareas in this range as indicated below   so any reversal in this area especially with proximity of ema 200 could be explosive   then if we use the log chawould the 6545 takeout generate enough fuelmomentumbuying pressure to drive over the trendline in log probably  depends on definition i agree that a small double bottom isnt enough to turn a trend but a triggered double bottom higher low higher high and trendline break in right context suppozone indicates more bullish action is coming if can be confirmed with trigger and volume  due to lower market cap ltc only a fraction of capital needed for same  change will likely rise stronger than btc which means that in this case you would make more profit trading ltc  i usually dont change scale in order to confirm my bias i use linear charts as i learned with them log charts may be useful in generating additional ideas and perspectives but the tool of choice will be linear for me as long as it works as intended  it does not actually most of my entries have been placed before volume enters the market this is why i enter so early in the first place i know the volume coming after the entry is triggered will forth on protect my entry level volume should come with break of 6545 high  when markets are more attractive than holidays again   when talking about safety waiting for confirmation on daily chais indeed advised so definitely agree on that as a trader my role is not playing it safe but entering as early as possible when signals are apparent and context is right for maximum roi and to be safe later on addition if btc manages to take out 6454 high on volume ltc would be my first coin of choice to enter due to obvious similarities in chaand behavior  8435 would be the signal trigger in this case buying below 100 likely profitable in the long run   its true therefore takeout of 6545 is a requirement for this call to be active otherwise we are just ranging what is paramount is that the daily chahas already indicated and triggered a buy signal hence entering in 6h 4h or even 2h is a possibility as odds are higher  good spot observing that ancient trendline as well  that is what the chais telling me people tend to forget what i am doing i am buying very very early and hold for a long time in fact you should worry if i stagiving late calls as my speciality is getting in so early that it is hardly visible yet for the sake of max roi  of course thats why i post it no need to post stuff like that if it already happened and the roi is gone anyway this is information purpose only confirm with your own independent views   would agree taking out 7k and 8k levels would do a lot of damage to bears which would likely be sufficient for a shift in sentiment towards bull  somewhat unlikely imho as the current flag correction is kind of weak i dont expect it to break down before attempting another run however this is trading and certainly everything is possible depends on how strong bulls really are around here  emas and candles by far my most preferred weapons of choice i do have stochrsi and obv attached to a chabut give it less importance than actual price action although i tried nearly all indicators out there in my career i came back to the roots candles and emas  trading around 5500 would make the double bottom invalid it would also be a failed breakout above trendline and a new lower low if that happens i would expect more bearish price action unlikely imho as the damage in the chawould be hard to recover from  naturally annotation is always subjective i see what you mean though although it does not fit in my understanding of things in your case then the takeout of 6848 high would be sufficient for a mtr  the catalyst will be early buyers driving up the price far away from their entry which they later will going to protect if you talk about news there is a strong correlation between completed price action patterns and likelihood of positive news release around that time  likelihood of a bull run emerging increases when 6545 is taken out as the pattern then would be higher lows higher highs which is the definition of an uptrend btc major trend reversal in progress turning from lower highslower lows into higher lowshigher highs trendline has been broken and is being retested from above double bottom has been triggered at 6300 takeout of 6545 high would be the confirmation by definition  ιf you have an overanalytical brain and you dont meditate you wont stay sane   just a friendly reminder   breakthrough below 6275 on volume would be more important to me than hourly close  dont assess too early dipping under 6300 does not mean suppois broken when it reverses back up technically the suppoheld so some patience is advised until more confirmation has arised 6300 entry level successfully retested now question remains will suppohold should the signal be valid we would 6300 entry level successfully retested now question remains will suppohold should the signal be valid we would continue to rise from here and generate a new high above 6545 if it doesnt we would retest 6000 to see if the bottomhl was legit solving existential crises through crypto crowdfunding will be a reality sooner or later we do have the power to change how we as a collective operate and crypto will be a way of facilitating that power into a more conscious and independent direction than ever before  indeed 6545 takeout might trigger an accelerated move observation mode here for the day btc market seems to be struggling to retest 6300 entry level which is either yet coming or can be seen as a sign of bullish strength in case a new high is generated   current battle supportive 3d ema 200 vs declining daily ema 20   daily charts deliver the best results usually the lower the timeframe the less trustworthy the signals with daily candles being the most precise this is also an entry on the 3 day chaafter having respected ema 200 on three consecutive candles and double bottom likely attracting sufficient volume  daily buy setup based on bullish engulfing after a higher low in anticipation of trendline break and volume advance first trendline has already been broken and successfully retested second line just above trigger potential early entry in hindsight  trigger 6301 sl 5790   exactly my friend its a whole dilemma unfolding if you are not positioned when a trend takes off there is so many techniques to safely accumulate a position and yet nobody seems to be overly enthusiastic using them i feel bear greed is apparent and greed seldom ends well if you have not entertained your mind at least with the idea of getting a position around these price levels in previous days or next you might have a painful awakening later this year  most now underestimate the power of a real btc bull and the king will make sure you remember  true that but strength seems to be slowly coming back for now it is a trading range as the green trigger has not been activated correction and a higher low is possible which would indicate the transition of trading range into trend reversal is in progress invalid if lt5780 btc bullish engulfing with rising volume forming on the daily chanear trendline time til candle close 40 mins    affirmative    buy markets percentage is a tool that may help you find the staand end of the bull market when it is less than 10 which maybe the bottom buy signals may appear soon the craziest thing is that people are upset at this amazing opportunity   if you get out then you miss out simple as tha then if we are somewhere between capitulation and depression the current state of the market would translate into point of maximum financial opportunity isnt that something  bullish arguments  huge if true  how long do investors plan to hold onto bitcoin  friendly reminder that we have seen nothing yet btc  bitcoin is in a profoundly bullish adoption curve i cover this in my latest article on hyperbitcoinization check it ou  0000 utc on bitcoinwisdom needs close above 6187 to make this a bullish reversal on daily impressive comeback btc re adoption curves  market share  i would suggest btc is at the first stage of the early adopter phase red   logic bein  i have a feeling this tweet will age well         5 maybe most real crypto personalities have not such an inflated ego and dont need constant approval and attention like others they know what they do and dont need to brag about it constantly  i would reply that it is possible yet unlikely from my perspective    usually declining volume indicates a corrective move while the turnaround and pumps legs in trend direction happen on increased volume the more volume a bar has the more significant it is when analyzing price action ie a strong bull reversal on high volume  likely more up ltcusd weekly  successfully retested previous high suppoat important psychological suppo100 with ema 200 acting as additional suppovolume declining waiting for bull move to occur   eventually a ihamps can be translated as a major trend reversal pattern which changes lower lows to higher lows and lower highs to higher highs  uptrend i dont think the distance of the lows is overly important crucial is only that this seems to be a higher low in the making   it isnt it is an indicated ihamps which needs another leg up towards neckline in order to become a valid ihamps by then everyone would see what pattern it is and it will be too late to enter in anticipation i like to be early  i think you are referring to the mktcap post yesterday assuming the ihamps will be completed and the neckline triggered that would lead me to a rough target of 650 b total mktcap however momentum generated in such move could be sufficient to break ath and generate new rally  total mktcap indicating potential ihamps after having dropped 70 from its peak which is sufficient for a correction if btc can confirm recent bullish breakout odds are well for a bullish takeover and a test of neckline  needs both confirmation and increased volume   it might but given the context i think a shosqueeze in this territory could potentially be devastating for bears if they lose control over the price with the recent comeback the daily chalooking nice for a decent chance of turnaround waiting for more information update btc

still intact this was not as bloody as i thought it would be not fully convinced by this move yet want to see bulls attempting to come back before assessing further eventually daily close will offer more information keep calm keep breathing im not buying im not selling im not shorting im not longing  there are moments when you just observe and wait for nan  well there will always be haters as you said probably hasnt even read it i will make sure i get a copy and see what you crafted there   thats exactly what i think a drop to 1k would be devastating for this space so i deem it rather unlikely my bet is on market makers trapping as many bears as possible then uptrend resumption but stay open to all scenarios because quite frankly nobody knows at this stage  there is a chance but low probability imho would be lovely to see alts rally while btc drops to 1k because this way we have a pretty good indication where the top for alts would be but quite frankly this sounds too good to be true in a way  further confirming what the emas already indicated strong move in the making should be spectacular either way  please read more here still active   addition 2  market makers have managed to generate as much panic as possible  without breaking technical key levels yet so i think they actually plan to  drive the price up quickly and trap as many bears as possible in an epic  shosqueeze pressure clearly is on bulls now addition i dont think the market could handle a decisive close below 7k without triggering massive panic so if the bullish narrative is still active which to me it is we must reverse here at trendline or it is gg for some prolonged time btc in a nutshell reversal here or basically rekt bearish resolution likely leads to target 1k bullish reversal on volume at trendline increases odds of positive outcome still bullish turning bearish in case 7k low wont hold  emas still indicate strong move in the making  dgb working on trendline  btc trendline close while emas bundled waiting for a decisive close above 7780 high which would be enough to trigger the small weekly bull reversal outlined earlier  if technology is our last chance at true independence bitcoin is so much more important than you may think   dont fck btcusd 7 month long consolidation soon coming to an end every dip since october 2017 bounced off a higher low expe nan   good questions deserve a time to be answered absolutely legit  nah 7780 is the high of the weekly bar that closed last night while 7040 is the low so these levels should be closely observed it is a race by now who triggers first will likely win this battle   most likely a violation of recent dryingout volume trendline by means of significant upside volume clearly above the line indicated  btc weekly candle closed as a small bull reversal now some retesting before attempting to break out either side of the range   gt 7780 bullish lt 7040 bearish  volume generally not sufficient yet might change with a potential bullish weekly trigger    not sure if serious or trolling if you notice we both have posted regularly about ltc in the last days  game plan with ltc usually patience patience patience boom rinse repeat ltcbtc peeking above trendline   first we want to see a close above the upper triangle trendline which increases the odds for a successful upside breakout secondly we would like to see the 530 local high taken out on volume then acceleration if you take the base of the triangle as tp it would lead to 1300 dgb approaching triangle trendline from below while emas are crossed upwards acting as suppobelow waiting for the trigger at 530 local high to confirm the major trend reversal in progress   gotta agree but wasnt it always like that i remember when ltc ranged around 4 for like eternity and then suddenly pushed up 100 in a day and never came back since so if anything actions awaits us with this one imo roger waters concepinkfloyd  ltc litecoin nice initial response to bullish engulfing on may 29th   y no tmek  it was alright to split off from original bitcoin to attempt pursuing satoshis original vision however everything that followed is wrong on so many levels to say the least  certainly in the range of possibilities should btc go the suspected path towards 50k when looking at the weekly ltcbtc chait becomes rather apparent that there is a lot of room to grow while the rally to 300 was rather a beginning trend reversal on weekly in progress    sure mate observing dgb closely here due to the large triangle converging emas back to upwards alignment so what we are waiting for is a volume push triggering whitegreen trendlines then acceleration im confident 2018 will be the real staof dgb have a bag   duality   this confirms thanks ltc seemingly ready to go on the daily successful wedge breakout would complete inversed head amp shoulders and trigger new buyers on volume into the market likely among the first to follow btc if 7600 is triggered  visa is down not a problem we have bitcoin  absolutely can still its good to have it on the radar shows that really everything is possible from here as there are also numerous fractals with that triangle breaking to the downside before the triangle actually breaks in either direction its all pure speculation btc nov 2015 fractal comparison would imply two more legs within current triangle before continuation breakout is attempted  dimon says technology is biggest threat to jpmorgans business  like bitcoin a chabuy signal could i said could not would occur in btcusd over the weekend stay tuned   lol thats a challenge improvise adapt overcome  only in highly significant situations with huge potential impact on price you probably see what i mean after we taken out last high all eyes on btc     experimented with many emas amp mas but eventually emas 20 100 and 200 delivered the best constant results no matter which chabeing viewed excited for tomorrow we are whitepaper anon advisorzcl could you please remove the tweet saying no devs are working just play your game  everything else is noise   oh well maybe a retest will do it zcl  well that was quick    exactly as serious as i called zcl last year at 1 before doing a x250 im a charts guy and this chascreams buy to me still observing zcl almost ripe again    yes  added on around 5 and again around here  observing this one particularly in the last days almost ripe how to get rich without getting lucky its all fine  im in the otc business a bullish engulfing in daily chahas been triggered after a shortterm correction yesterday waiting for additional confirmation of the signal above recent 7600 high breakout failed for now needs further retesting before attempting another move up btc bullish engulfing at supporting trendline on slightly higher volume already triggered another push up would likely liquidate bears bear stop losses indicated by red lines and potentially generate enough fuel to break the trendline above not out of the woods yet but evolving  a strange change in sentiment in btc whenever i posted a chanegative in decjan i received wrath on twitter now wh nan  true that it indeed needs further confirmation before technically calling it a higher low thanks for pointing that out any trigger below 7000 would make this assumed higher low invalid which i dont see happening as for now  probably too early to tell given we need more bullish confirmation before resuming however i came up with the prediction in the beginning of the year and there is nothing happening right now that would make me belief otherwise closeup btc towards endofyear target  two consecutive higher lows have been printed now waiting for the first hig closeup btc towards endofyear target  two consecutive higher lows have been printed now waiting for the first higher high currently around 10k to confirm major trend reversal   was a crucial point in the chaand for now very glad bulls managed to drive up the price momentarily time will tell whether this breakout will succeed but it was absolutely critical for bulls to drive up the price at suppootherwise this could have gotten ugly rather quick  after months of withering nothing wrong with some positive outburst despite being predominantly an observer i remain a bull and i love green bars   well played mate well played  7600  7700ish which is the top of last structure so bears will try to defend their stoplosses around this level h1 h2 h4 h12 bars close in 10 minutes so another strong push into the close would be welcome btc  yeah speed decreased somewhat in this regard which is fine i am still holding both btcp and zcl they both will get their attention again in due time boom  still time for a decisive upward move in btc to avoid daily emas 100amp200 to cross downwards for continuation of major uptrend bulls would defend against such cross which they will attempt now amp in the coming days   for now just an attempt there is more resistance above so just close observation for now btc h1  well ltc chikun already in upward motion after testing longterm trendline same line as in btc showing move in advance again  crisis in italy  good traders just like good chess players are strategists lifelong students of the market will do very well in the longterm get rich quick prospectors will leave the game broke   thank you for the warm words long may they live  crypto 2018 welcome to forex i believe btc will follow the spx and complete the abcde correctional triangle wave soon  in 14 days from here btc will be in the

bullish emas still in uptrend trendline broken waiting for confirmation at green   there is many ways to draw a line the most prominent are wick to wick and close to close i use a variation in which i connect the wick to the close which gives me a slight advantage in entering a little cheaper before others will edge in this case is being in 150 earlier   draw the line that makes most sense in that context not to confirm bias  well bitcoinwisdom once was the place for btc and ltc and it is still displaying the btce price when it went down seems like nobody bothered about changing it i like it as a memory  connected the highest wick with the highest close of the following high usually gives you a little edge as it gets confirmed faster which then later leads to the confirmation of the

is solid suppoforming around this level so i deem this scenario less likely than a bull run   dunno i tend to keep things simpler to me its a structure that might lead to a bullish breakout which

flipping here rekt  these influencers have gathered followers for their knowledge about the most widely applicable tool that is revolut   exactly which means by ta standards it will attempt to retest its ath it does not mean it will retest 22 mio but it will be attempted that number is high so if we reach only a fraction of that ath price the profits will be astonishing  i am a big fan of anon coins besides i watched the opening of zec trading live and saw it reaching astronomous heights from a ta perspective i expect zec to attempt retesting its all time high when the bull is finally established one of the few charts without rally yet added to my zec position in anticipation of a higher low being formed in buy range on the daily chawhich would then be the bottom before the major turn up   what a nonsense bs to say there are infinite strategies all working in a different manner if buying higher means having more security for the trade to be profitable especially if you trade longer timeframes like daily i certainly go for it you go on sniper on leverage another perspective on btc 3d chashows bullish reversal at log trendline amp ema 200 which would be a 2nd buy signal if closed and triggered after we already formed a triggered reversal bar earlier orange in the same range    it is triggered so any break of 8635 finex will very likely lead to further upside acceleration independent of specific timesframes there we go btc confirmed yesterdays buy signal confirmation would be a close above 8605  it is by now obvious that the chais actively manipulated by groups of interest trading crypto now feels more like forex now and i feel this will only further accelerate one of the reasons i am a holder price action will get trickier in the future beware the traps btc touched the log trendline to the tick and reversed on healthy volume bullish for me and a potential entry long here or with further confirmation above last doji    well it is widely known that you guys have an edge in these things so only natural thanks for the input friend  maybe talk to  and  about these things as it seems to be their ultimate  what you just said is key learning most in darkest times reap what you saw in bright times  without taking price action in consideration twitter is so bearishtoxic right now a bullrun would be highly justified  golden age will inevitably come patience is needed to get there i dont bother if it is now in a couple of months of even years it will come and i will be ready that is all that counts  when everybody stops panicking and selling his bags to the banksters that are so eager to accumulate when the supply is getting so low while demand is rising we will get there not there yet so patience  connecting lows means predicting mathematically where a bounce may occur therefore you have to observe price action in the context of that line in order to assess if valid or not you want both bullish price action and context to make a profitable trade relax you wont even remember this dip two years from here so why bother  there is no imaginary lines this is math observe what happens at that line in terms of price action then make up your own mind reversal at trendline possible but gravity is high now btc   it is peculiar how the neverending story is getting much attention recently watched it a few days ago because i had the urge today alone i saw like three mentions in different occasions well the synchronicity it must be a government outright banning use of a privacy coin validates the need for privacy coins to

something that update btc trendline retest from above has been completed bullish engulfing at ema 200 suppoon the daily chaexpecting strong breakout and upside in the coming days and weeks     btc retesting trendline from above with supportive ema 200 below  nan we are pleased that our mission has captured the attention of mainstream media outlets such as  in such a shope market sentiment often looks like a battle between bulls vs bears  traders chato conform to their bias and take thing  thats the kinda charts i am looking for very low range which means massive upside potential when it pops which of course depends on fa which i will research  sure that is to be expected im acquiring a new coin list to analyze laters if i find something significant i give it back and share my views    jo nach ca einer woche wird btcp bei bittrex gutgeschrieben wenn du zcl über den snapshot gehalten hast name one coin that is very low in range and has significant potential for upside longterm no icos no new listings just solid projects with great fa if you held zcl for btcp and sold zcl after snap you might have experienced huge losses however a fair valuation of that trade can only be made as soon we know how btcp is valued curious what you think where btcp will be trading at in the first days calm before the storm grab your popcorn brace yourselves zcl  mind that  plans to deactivate trading 15 minutes before the snapshot trade accordingly sell for btc or hold for btcp might come handy   transferred them yesterday in case bittrex would not suppoit or closes wallets for the snapshot which they did zcl plan is as follows   transferred majority of funds to electrum to receive btcp selling minor positions on the way up towards snapshot  good luck my friends may the green be with you thanks for the helpful answers much appreciated two questions hope someone can clarify  1 if i temporarily disable 2fa on bittrex will the deactivation of 2fa have negative implications on my daily withdrawal limits and if how  2 should i decide to change the 2fa device or number is there any delay expected    has announced they will be crediting zclassic holders with bitcoinprivate   btcp fork suppoon  zcl  source      i called zcl at 1 so i have a natural interest in bringing this trade to a clear end  spectacularly maneuvered themselves in the corner by not providing any statement on zclbtcp whatsoever leaving their customers in the shades should they not provide a statement until snapshot it is definitely the last trade i did there announce or gtfo hal finney imagine that bitcoin is successfulthat gives each coin a value of about 10 million 2009  we are proud to announce that  will be listing bitcoinprivate   btcp    happened to me many times it takes a certain kind of strength to have trust in your analysis and to not get trapped out of a good trade due to doubt will dissolve in the future just keep on going  i dont think there is any successful trader out there who hasnt busted his portfolio at least once i personally destroyed three accounts before being able to trade profitable consider it as tuition fee some day you will be looking back and be grateful for the lessons learned who owns circle   i found the catch in the venezuelan petro  rather than redeemable for oil the government will redeem it for the value  retested 100 supponow whales currently driving up the price right now price sits at trendline h1 either breakthrough or another leg down to retest the new suppoagain closely observing   the sl is placed at the low of the previous candle if you trade the breakout as indicated in the attached picture in the case of pic above that sl run would be a trap which can be avoided through experience and proper analysisassessment of the market does that help     well it mainly depends what you do with the money you earned i would like to see many crypto traders actually giving back to the community by making this world a better place through either speaking up or using money to make a change  i see your point there is one particular activity that generates more income while doing nothing and that is passive income however i am deeply passionated about charts so that is what i like to do even if there was no money involved  thanks el duderino  google was my fa teacher still is so no books when it comes to fundamental analysis for me  mostly those    there are multiple emotionals barriers and lessons to learn which is inevitable when you begin trading with bigger position sizes if you initially could survive a 1000 drop because you had a tiny position ask your feeling again if you x10 your position size many lessons push  if you want to work less go a timeframe higher you can trade in daily charts or even weekly which means you have a look at charts once per dayweek   yt is nice for a stabut superficial if you want the depth of understanding no way around books imho   in the following order  1  beginner german book substitute with an english book focused on very beginners to get the basics  2  advanced  3  master  definitely an old soul in a young body thanks for the kind words  will keep it up i would advise to stareading beginner books on trading theory and combining that with paper trading  you buy and you sell so nothing changes from the trading perspective just your position size gets bigger over time management of a big portfolio and the taxproblem inherent in these things is a completely different matter  i would advise to stareading beginner books on trading theory and combining that with paper trading  replay function in tradingview which is amazing for starting if you feel confident stawith real money tiny positions to learn the emotional side of trading practice i consider trading to be the most scalable of jobs sure everybody starts small but if you stick with it you will not only get better through learning but profits will be much higher than intially due to rising bankroll  the work stays the same     as soon as your identity is revealed there will be people around you leeching manipulating and being interested in what you do to a degree that will interrupt your way of work which is not desired when you solely wanna focus on doing your thing    well if you choose the path of public exposure do it fully i think most of the ones who prefer to stay anon have no desire for interviews building a image or working with companies anyways     first thing to do close dms helped heaps still overloaded but at least you can control it that way      i imagine it to be quite exhaustive emergency plan create a new account dont let anybody know operate on both until you have established yourself with the anon one    also there is a crucial thing to consider once you go public there are many external influences and it will be difficult to do independent quality work that way only focus delivers that and focus means no external factors disturbing your force thus stay anon deliver quality   once decision is made to go from anon to public game over it is cant be undone so choose wisely and think longterm here too you guys have alot of work ahead of you if you wanna be successful in crypto  when i first got into crypto i literally top 14 traders by followers count  1  2  3  4   rex announced btg suppolike two days prior to the event if zcl has been attop volume on  they surely do not want to miss out on potential profits via fees so rather should look into supporting the fork otherwise everybody will withdraw which means profit   bittrex has proven that they have no problem announcing suppotwo days prior to snapshot or forks so that might get pretty interesting update six days before snapshot  zcl retested triangle from above correction seems to be finished after two legs down ema 200 acts as additional suppoif trend is still valid we would see a bounce here soonish fueled by exchange supponews could trigger a strong leg up   haha good catch yes sir i am in the riddle      ez    bought at 18 as usual willing to hold not selling anything especially not as low as here  calling doge an abandoned project clearly indicates you have not been around in crypto for long but i am not here to convince you otherwise do what you must      me waiting for augur to go live  update doge  buy early check survive the dip check let roll in progress  bears feeling the heat yet if btc doesnt stop here we are in for a shosqueeze  today is a holiday in america  the banks and markets are closed meanwhile bitcoin soldiers on with over 1b transmitted and 7  just advancing what the chatells me mate after all etc is the original chain hope that helps    hope that helps   update etceth if alarm goes off bears better protect their trendline otherwise we see a huge flippening run  assuming i wanna bet on btc hitting 50k in 2018 where would i go  probably because i always did with amazing results all i see these days is this massive btc bull reversal on monthly   sure will riddles as a race i love it i hope it is solvable for normal humans without codingencryption skills though interesting surely giving it a go  i think most people severely underestimate the factor of fomo when btc starts to get real traction again if we take out ath we are in for a heaven of a ride      longer term view on btc price  first sell off followed by a bear trap bullish break of the wedge would lead to renewed global media coverage above ath making 50k a pretty conserative target for 2018     which is funney thanks for the lovely saturday interpretation session     oh i think the trees actually show the entire crypto economy for every time banks instituations and other key players in the old system trying to limit or stop crypto there are dozens of new altcoins popping up making this whole money movement more decentralized   dont feel bad about it the fact that you realize it speaks for yourself if anything selfreflection is probably the most important skill as a trader and as a being in general    it is of course subjective what i understand this depicts is the desperation of the old systembanks trying to get crypto under control and yes you actually have to pay for fiat most incomes are in fiat while inflation decreases the value steadily they print at free will   that is what i actually find astonishing he is never tired of asking questions even when i have limited time to answer he has the patience to wait as well shows me that if you really really wanna learn it there is no way to stop you   please elaborate respect to  for being one of the most motivated learners i have come to known in trading yet although i realize learning trading from the very beginning is a tough nut to crack i am delighted to see you putting lots of effointo it kudos    polo charts and paint what a time to be alive  thanks friend  etc zec  and most of the altcoins  bitcoin crypto  ltc  vtc just confirmed yesterdays buy signal   as far as i know they plan to make a real game out of this which is an exciting idea and brings in value for the cards itself  you got me with that name amp jupiter aurora gotta love geralt   i think it is more comparable to the martingale system in roulette everybody doubles their eth until nobody buys it anymore this way the only loser is the one who eventually holds the card and figures he cant do anything with it integration into a real game would create value  yeah it is  they have created multiple cards with a low starting price whenever someone buys the card from you he has to double the price    that escalated quickly i understand it is all about fun just mind that the money you throw at it might never come back to you in case nobody else is going to buy the card from you i never owned the card and i dont intend to do so eventually just saying  all the best  vtc with a triggered buy setup in daily found by    thats how it is meant   when ya scroll your gifs way too far nan   sending you a dm lets not spam his wall  continue the great work    i dont think  is particularly interesting in decentraland nor is this post about crypto in the first place    probably cant as i havent been on twitter then bought a huge stack at 0005 and told everyone to get on board before i actually realized what i am supporting    it is always easy in retroperspective it is not that easy when you call it at half a cent still worst crypto project   gotta agree thanks for the feedback in a gentle way   fair enough if it is not true i may apologize for this particular thing however the core message that media is highly manipulative stays true my mission is partly to make aware of that thanks for letting me know though will fact check more qualitative  scam dont send money there always check for the correct  name  you wrote 118 three times now it does not make sense to me  consider reading your question again bitcoin break through 10000 will usher in a new burst of news coverage and a fresh wave of buying  can i have my satoshilite battle my naval in the decentraland  y no yoda card tho  means higher low people seem to be puzzledworried about low volume on a recovery do you realize thats a good thing because the sell below any of my most solid calls people were yelling but the volume i feel many of you are obsessed with volume which in turn keeps you from getting the profitable positions that you are looking for anticipate the spots where volume comes into the market buy before that and here comes btc break of 9k and off we go       thats conserative actually i do charts and probabilities upside potential for ltc is evident in all my charts  lovely perspective whole market preparing for upside goldenage coming to a place near you soon   we just switched from downtrend to uptrend in weekly chaso the rally is just starting here do not sell too early 2018 will be huge for ltc be patient and let the trend unfold before making any moves first target would be 01 more is definitely possible  true never dumped on any of my entries quality of entries may vary depending on market phase and individual learning eventually i want everybody to be wealthy so we can stachanging this place for the better which is urgently needed    forgive me my ltc shilling no way i can just let it pass without banging the drum  1000 today would make my day but severely unrealistic that will happen    surprises me as well doesnt even make sense  dunno im focused on the long run not the shortterm potential   dont fall for it they have caught enough already  scam reported blocked  1000 easily i sincerely hope you took the seriousness of my post for real and got your bag of ltc one week ago happy riding gents   went to bed ltc pumping waking up ltc pumping    oversold market broken trendline fomo and liquidation of bears     on an arithmetic scale basis ltcusd has had a decisive upside breakout   just hold this stuff  in case of ltc that hamps has failed  patiently and positive    mind that this is a guess needs validation in chart ltc likely showing what is coming to btc soonish wouldnt be the first time either  when it breaks last high  not too late ltc  etc  proof that patience pays dividends   hodl 4 the win  etcbtc 5 month high  ethereum classic etc price reaches 5 month high  etc btc fintech news crypto etc muh love   feel ya i am not entirely sure about how to play it will develop in due time  seeing a lot of upside potential yet very curious about this scenario playing out if 500 does not hold as resistance things would escalate though again at the time of the btcp snapshot zcl will have a value of beautiful new bitcoin street ain paris by ludo   si cada millonario del mundo quisiera comprar 1 btc no habria suficientes hagan lo que quieran    bitfy  technically a first target would be around 0006 which is the same height as the double bottom formation more is possible though  additional etc analysis in daily   double bottom has been triggered we now have higher highs higher lows thus likely the beginning of a prolonged uptrend   two yellow lines are signifcant past highs so i would expect more bulls entering this market much more potential imho update etc running smoothly  the crypto community is one of the most collaborative communities and one of the most rewarding to be a paof  honored to if youre not watching ethereum classic etc youre doing it wrong computers are stupid lets use this paper instead  internet is stupid lets use this paper instead  email is stupid  amazing thanks for sharing i simply love yodastarwars artwork  update etc successfully broke amp confirmed the wedge to the upside now letting it fully unfold golden cross initiated   gotta love cyrves  somewhere in early adopters imho plenty of room  caption the margin traders psychology chart coincidence   and the  goes to   actually it is quite alright except when markets are in euphoria or the scammers make their rounds again   he is now addictive to substratum though the amount of people i have blocked during the last week is spiking considerably if you spam or try to scam

zec triggered weekly and daily chashotarget 11 long target 2425 zcash zec btc  it seems like the whole market ist waiting for btc to signal the go will btc turn around or push through that resistance closely watching now most promising chafor me is still zec though  doge  dow down bitcoin up  got bitcoin               i never did a proper ff so i thought its time to give some further directions for those looking to dive deeper into crypto while giving thanks at the same time                          amp many more thank you for what you do  ff 12 random order                                     wtf did i just watch  by give to the lord you mean sending some eth to your address    more people bought than sold   takeshis castle  ltc chikun eager for upside  what a lovely day that is       seems like btc favors the failed head n shoulder scenario more as for now  hut in the woods instead of yacht then  etceth generating early momentum   some volume for the sta    and likely you will get rewarded for that patience   but we do it so its fine  if you take into consideration that the majority of coins will rise in marketcap dgb does not have to get to the top5 to hit that target       coins you hold on exchange is technically not your property but that of the exchange you dont own these coins as the exchange holds the private keys stagoogling cold storage bitcoin to get an idea then go on from there get back control of your coins   pretty much similiar although the right charts shows a gap instead of a full bar i found daily charts most useful for making trading decisions 2h for getting additional details anything below these timeframes is considered not trustworthy at least from a longterm perspective  and you too friend  i never understood that perspective in a perfect world there should be no devs needed to work on the code if the network is running smoothly and hits no resistance in terms of scaling etc code should be law  i like to enter after early bulls have indicated buying pressure so im fine with a little run prior to my entry to add odds of success  thanks mate lbc beginning to look good here after trying to retest suppozone again should be good to go if green trendline breaks to upside preferably on volume    yes firm believer of dgb underlying tech amp fundamentals great project  trading on several exchanges is safer due to diversification of capital however safest way to hold is obviously to setup cold storages for your coins many exchanges will come and many will go be safe out there   i do not however there is a potential head n shoulders forming in btc 2h either completion of the pattern will lead to another leg down or the pattern fails and we see a strong breakout from here observing   still working with polobittrex mainly  should come with the break of the trendline observing i love it when i post charts and everyone shares their own insight  ta on that chain the comments to include more perspectives and value  thanks   anything else would indeed surprise me  longterm for me  nah he just stole the name and tries to make a living off it karma will figure   thanks for showing us what a dickhead you are continue to plant seeds like that and your gonna be having a bad bad future karma will figure  blocked  either buy here or wait for the green line to be broken to have more odds of success dgb with a higher low

if when it breaks the trendline on volume etc pending for upside   if you believe it or not there is actually a lot of weekly and daily chatraders that actually look for solid confirmation in higher

disappointing ltc on the way to trigger alarms are set  not quite sure about the implications though maybe someone who knows can elaborate on it all i know is they are halted trading on xiv for several times today is this telling us something vix inversed   vix is the ticker symbol that was introduced to measure the severity of the ups and downs of the stock market   agree crypto will bleed initially but as soon as everyone figures out that traditional markets wont be coming back and silver and gold are kinda difficult to transpothey will have a 2nd coming as the only asset that can be

button here nothing can save you   that is what yoda would say cryptoyoda actually evolved into being capable of writing properly only occasionally falling back to old habits  i consider it  that is what we are here for the unchartered territory let the traditional markets melt down it was inevitable still if you are in both metals and crypto i think you have played this scenario pretty well and will get rewarded for that foresight in the future i dont recall how many of these dips i have experienced i do recall however that it gets easier to hold around the more dips you have experienced stay calm and focused eventually it does not matter remember it is only temporary you will endure have faith amp stay strong  so in that regard 1 btc still is 1 btc everything else is just paper losses  margin trade  chance of losing your entire capital thus dont margin trade only a loss if you hit that button otherwise it is just an experience in mental strength that will reward you for your patience same story different year guess what comes nextbitcoin  if you bought high hodl and hang in there better days will eventually be here if you cant afford to hodl then you gamb stock market to bitcoin hold my beer  only if you hit the sell button update 2  world wide meltdown   this too shall pass         aiming for nothing less than that the current financial system must inevitably go in order to have means to implement that cultural solution         labels boxes assuming everyone values freedom and being fully responsible for his or her own actions decentralized currencies without third party control will provide that freedom that mankind needs to thrive         in a world with decentralized currency constant conflict is impossible millennials embrace btc et al in paas reaction to 217 tril of global debt and massive wealth inequality forced upo make sure to follow  for some quality spiritual input that the world needs so desperately undervalued  that is the speculation i am not entirely sure about how i am going to play it depends on what happens in the next two weeks   the amount of twitter traders that actually have access to mrbrandts feed is dropping significantly it seems i like his input not always agreeing but thats by no means resistance for me the fact that his views are backed by experience is something to be taken into account gents relax i am just following up on my call and expressing my positive views in regard of zclbtcp which by the way wasnt scheduled back in those days just make sure you know what you are doing if you going to play this hardfork situation dyor  zcl before the prefork bull run three weeks until snapshot fork will take place two days later what an interesting scenario  the gamble of a generation win it all or try again    learned my lessons in that regard i stick to the basics but we all know different traders different ways there is no holy grail    absolutely in a nutshell trendlines supportampresistance price action patterns and volume plus some emas or other indicator to back it up  its a chawith a line and caption in it which does not really make sense to me what is it supposed to say   also no news for me i do take into consideration fundamentals which is the backbone of my portfolio but newswallsrumours have no effect on my investment decisions whatsoever mostly i am a technical trader happy when both fa and ta is rock solid  i dont look at walls walls can be fake i trust in actual price movement and the analysis of that more bullish times coming for btc opened more longs here  and here comes btc with exactly the same pattern likely strong breakout incoming if bears fail to defend that high  when the profile description completely nails it   ltc at trigger lets see how strong bulls are now  i confirm i am closely observing etc zec zen ltc amp zcl as for now  thanks for the input i like that  that is quite obvious yeah what interests me is the slight differences in both charts and the potential clues we might draw from that        that is what price action is indicating although more proof would be nice to have like a proper close above the small green line or a breakout above the upper trendline looks decent to me how much did the dow drop today 666 points let me say it again666 coincidence i think not    afaik the deutsche bank supports this idea if they do it is likely false fud for me        ltc looks fine too  ltc with an interesting setup similar to btc  o three touches failed breakout below trendline then strong reversal o h4 bull reversal bar is already triggered o price successfully retested ema 200 in daily now looking up         zec etc zen why use wall street psychology cheat sheet if you can also just use the dow jones psychology cheat sheet    pc cant stand aiming with controllerz  i do see the play button however when i click it the music stops playing no more no less   more like    money gotta go somewhere if investors flee traditional markets as they are all falling they will seek shelter in both metals and crypto traditional individuals probably fancy gold and silver the more avid investors may choose crypto or a combination of those  sure am btc will thrive especially with traditional markets crumbling at least in my world we will see how this plays out sure welcome mate   there probably is investors will try to protect their capital in a bearish market so some of them will venture into crypto especially if it is rising again timing could not be better also the correlation will increase in the future accelerated by selloffs in dow et cetera  dow jones this is actually getting intense  last friday bofas imminent market crash signals was just triggered  dow crashes 500 points vix tops 16  update further crashing  zen slowly preparing for breakout     lmao  now that might become interesting dowjones   forsaken the dark side you must     we have a failed breakout below that line which is a bullish reversalengulfing in 2h chaon significant volume hence a solid buy signal if btc manages to drive the price a little higher it may become a bull reversal in daily as well exactly at ema 200 as we had this discussion yesterday btc update    well he is a bit salty after everyone mocked him for his bearish views but to be fair the crypto crowd can be pretty tough does not change the fact he has superior experience in markets in comparison to most traders in younger generations thanks for the conversations im out to set up my telescope i heard the moon is around the corner tonight   only take from that post what you can he mentions 7600  7800 area and can back it up with three reasons even though we can only assume the reasons that is some useful information in addition to your own analysis  when someone says end of crypto it triggers my buy mechanism i think the 7600 to 7800 level will be extremely interesting to watch for three reasons i will not mentio  thanks for the response  might switch the trend  in your highly classical way of assessing charts do you think a retest of previous high at 8k is unlikely curious about your view in that regard   a complete ingame economy based on crypto that lets you work ingame for real cash is the future preferably with players contributing processing power that is not needed for the game to the blockchain  that is what we need to end the correction i am feeling many newcomers are having a sweaty time right now just about to do something foolish most have never experienced a proper dip  oh you absolutely do not have to it is just my way of doing things   the traditional advice in that situation would be if you are afraid stabuying otherwise if you are determined to hold close ur laptop and spend your time otherwise until markets are green again  mana is a foundation of the polynesian worldview a spiritual quality with a supernatural origin and a sacred impersonal force  yes you read that right the force  reminds me to setup my telescope thanks mate  well we all started sometime i never shorted also not in the beginning there are so many markets in the world and something is always rising i just do not see the point why i would prefer to focus on suppressing something rather than supporting if the work is the same although i was never particularly interested in manadecentraland it seems to be calling me on a regular basis very interesting concept feel free to share your opinion  market is very efficient in fooling so escaping that fooling is somewhat complicated the single thing you can ensure is to learn one thing every time you get fooled   now i am curious about the details of that correlation  i am not comfortable in supressing markets i look for things that i can suppoand go with that flow    in this regard there is a prime function in tradingview where you can replay the chabar after bar in your  in this regard there is a prime function in tradingview where you can replay the chabar after bar in your favorable speed magnificent for paper trading in real time with instant feedback     agreed trendline is drawn from close to close so behavior of price would be interesting to watch in this area  i am one of the few traders that never shomarkets i suppoprojects that i believe in i dont have to be the resistance  oh no when there is too much hype around a coin i dont even bother checking however i did now anyways it does not look convincing to me also you would be buying very high without many daily bars formed while trendline has been broken would wait for more information  the market is currently inviting investors to make mistakes and it will end its move by fooling as many traders as possible   everybody waiting for a 8k retest so if we bounce just above that level the market would fool most  both technical analysis by murphy and reading price action bar to bar by al brooks is excellent for learning stawith a beginner book in ur native language then go on with murphy experiment a lot take from the books what you need and can use at that time leave the rest  it is not really about the speed of the reversal but the shape of bars and individual legs that need to be assessed as soon as there are higher lows and higher highs in daily it is potentially time to plant early seeds back that with fa and you are good to go   some examples of that three points  failed breakout    lemme see if i find any good example  in a nutshell the transition from lower highs lower lows downtrend into higher highs higher lows uptrend in daily chart  it just looks like consolidation in a falling wedge nothing unusual about that correction at this point  fundamental research  early price action  i never was a believer of that axiom if i wait for three touches before i draw that line i would miss many opportunities for early entries i rather look how prices react at that third touch if they respect the trendline that i drew after two points it is valid to me  disagree in fact it is one of my favorite setups three touches of that trendline then a failed breakout below strong reversal up too early though  it just indicates the potentiality of massive suppoat either of these levels  consolidation that is needed for a healthy trend mind that both trendline and ema 200 sit below current price in daily btc  well i should add that i bought etc at 1 instead not doing the same mistake again  only way to learn  please do not remind me that i bought eth at 1 then sold at three digits before i implemented my hodl strategy evolution is painful sometimes eth with

of zen  morning wisdom from bob             oh no absolutely not bought purely due to technical reasons was a great entry long down there only after the initial breakout things started to develop and

players do not actively access the force in and around themselves it would not be really considered to be fair just imagine yoda as a goalkeeper  most do not get what i was actually saying when you dont have anything you think money is everything as soon as you have more than enough you realize happiness was never about the monies  nothing in average i make great profit every day by not doing anything but holding it just does not make me happier that is what i was referring to  agreed money is important when you have not enough to pay bills and such what i specifically meant is that there is a monetary threshold after which having even more money does not make any more sense  very nice lovely to observe your progress   just a shorather unspectacular update dear   etc broke the trendline currently in the retest of that trendline from above expecting bullish movements in the next days hodl rick hodl   you have a site of your artworks mate  thanks mate warm words there are many more great folks to follow so welcome to twitter my friend   yoda just loves football although 900 years is quite too old to be active i am an amazing spectator though money is not everything  zcl seemingly ready for next leg up after trendline has been broken amp successfully retested  in this regard watch the resolution of the triangle in daily  i agree the force is strong with zen also lovely artwork     technically i am in no favor of a particular outcome this is just what i perceive when i observe the price action in higher timeframes obviously it is subjective and the outcome may be different but it is my best guess at this point including all variables at my disposal  for further clarification taking only the closes measuring from top to bottom we hit that target just below 10k from which btc has reversed and built higher lows which is pretty bullish to me if it manages to break the top of bear reversal at 17000  alt market possible fractal   measured from highest and lowest close of the leg and projected onto second leg highest close  möglich letztendlich habe ich das alte ath auf 1000 immer noch auf meinem zettel price action sagt mir zumindest dass sich ein boden entwickelt an signifikantem suppoda wir ohnehin longterm einen aufwärtstrend haben wäre die fortsetzung eine logische konsequenz   please feel free to share your view  it becomes dramatically less likely to break below last hl if the bears get stopped out above that bearish reversal bar at green so waiting for this confirmation will likely be a smamove otherwise too risky bullish on btc after measured move target has been hit amp secutive higher lows have formed around strong 10k suppoearly entry into trend continuation invalid if structure breaks down below last hl instead   true but what was is not what will be  u sure bro   yeah it is not a particularly safe trade to do but willing to take it in order to get in early  willing to find out btc triggered a higher low trend reversal entry not sure if that is bottom or just a leg up added on my position just in case   absolutely anyone who researches how our financial system works must inevitably come to the conclusion that it cannot survive it will come down just a matter of time imho  thus silently accumulate dont talk about it its an insurance   paper derivates will likely become worthless as soon as banks and brokers go broke mind that  i prefer small units as it can be exchanged for goods in the very worst case scenario hard to barter a bread against a bar of silver  definitely physical buy store amp hold the ultimate life insurance for fierce economic conditions  true that but mind that crypto basically is invisible magic internet money protect yourself amp diversify into hard valuable assets as well     gold also good bet i expect silver to be more profitable though in the long run i have and will further diversify into metals mostly silver in order to be wellpositioned for the inevitable economic collapse of fiat money and traditional markets if you see it coming prepare as by the time the crisis is here it will likely be too late additional view of silver in daily   basically the same thing bottoming out apparently silver slowly coming of age inversed head amp shoulders forming in weekly after triggering bull reversal in monthly  mmmmmonster kill  interesting  nan deutsche bank correlation between bitcoin and wall streets fear index is increasing dramatically     this is so wrong   there are two scenarios for btc until a direction is decided there will be low action during the day we might bounce around 11k suppoand make this small correction a bear trap or we go lower to retest 8000 area first excellent thread       post what you really think not what the crowd wants to hear  w00t please elaborate price action on alts the last 24h hours tells me a few things  1 there is a lot of money in crypto that has no intention  some years forex to show me how to not trade bitcoin our moonmission     target 15k bitcoin  break the downward trending line and were back to bull if not were going back down below 10k aft its going to be a rough decade for the crowd that keeps hoping bitcoin will die  at some point it gets annoying for everybody involved been there done that the misunderstandings were priceless though  in the 12h example we see a failed breakout below the ema 200 which is often seen in corrections of strong bull trends it traps in additional sellers just to drive the price back up quickly after forcing them out of their positions thus driving the price higher  the doji is an equilibrium between buyers and sellers if a doji appears after a selloff it means sellers are becoming exhausted and the reversal may take place in this context with both ema 100 and trendline successfully tested this is a good sign   cant completely take that off the table however most huge bull runs stawith a bear trap so lets see what you got btc btc with a buy setup after a failed breakout below ema 200 in 12h chaexhaustion doji at longterm trendline after retesting ema 100 in daily  google  trends  showing some etc some good  via   googletrends ethereumclassic classic      turn of mobile as well panic from friends doesnt make the situation any easier eventually we all got to deal with it ourselves  the usual dip will recover in due time dont worry too much and spend time offline if too heavy emotionally  still hodling around pretty interesting days for sure what a lovely day to observe  indeed its btc inverted buy this you would  so who is left when the last willing buyer leaves the stage   buy crypto  ouch   just fomo buy when they suddenly realize that their target buy level will not be hit at that point prices are pretty high already so they will discontinue their predefined strategy to chase the move up if controlled and with a strategy all fine most are not like that though  ah i get the reference indeed would have loved to see a clean bounce from suppolike indicated in previous chahowever the trend setup is still valid im curious about which way this will unfold good thing is for sure action is back in the markets  simple the trend is still active as higher highs ampamp higher lows is still valid trendline break is an indication of a potential trend reversal however must not mean that it actually will stopps of swing traders currently reside at red line  i think most traders anticipating four digits btc are playing a risky game mind the strong psychological suppolevel of 10k uptrend is still valid if prices reverse around here trend would be intact amp most of these traders will fomobuy back in or lose out  just my 2 cents its getting interesting btc make it or break it moment this time it will be different   technically it is not yet a valid lower low it is slightly higher than the 10700 low on this chaif it holds it will become a double bottom if it breaks down below it becomes more ugly  ema 20 100 200 grey red yellow  there is a time to speak and a time to be silent when markets are red i am focused on other stuff mostly btc retesting previous channel trendline amp ema 100 on daily   have a little bag very patient on this one same story as zcl basically bought at the first technical buy signal now hodling and anticipating some kind of positive news like zcl announced btcp hardfork some week after the same signal potential buy setup btc after retest of broken trendline and another higher low    thats the beauty of the market use it fractals doge preceeding etc in similiar pattern   the higher time frame is the dominating one so you staat the highest timeframe and begin to move down into shorter term time frames to get an accurate picture of the market  patience will solve that too ah here we go its indeed ltc looks quite spectacular in weekly view   ah here we go its indeed ltc looks quite spectacular in weekly view   guess little riddle   much influenced by buddhist philosophy

about this in 2018 as well  all good no offense taken at all   am not focused on news at all they have no pain my game im a purely technical trader and am very patient with holdings like vtc etc zec and more all will have their time  will buy some real wealth in 2018 property land realcash silvergold the latter question sounds interesting though you wanna elaborate on that  it started before my tweet im just trying to make aware   yeah im not so much a gemhunter im focused on solid stuff with some riskier coins in between  oh the usual thing testing patience of holders  thats the thing with daytrade maybe you make some good trades but it is unlikely you will outperform bottom buyers that just hodl the longer the rally the more parabolic the portfolio goes as a hodler xzc looking promising here in 2h as emas are bundled amp trendline is close   not sure if i understand your question right if you talk about targets i dont have any i just dont operate using targets i analyze when the trend begins to weaken and try to scale out of my positions around the top no time or price target for that    zcl dgb ltc doge pivx xzc etc zen xmr staxmy neo bnt eqt lmc vtc rep bcy  only bags that barely move but full trust they will so im alright with practicing my patience when analyzing my portfolio chai cant get around to come to the  conclusion that the next days and weeks seem to become astonishingly  profitable dunno how that is supposed to work as i am already up 460  in btc in 4 weeks by just hodling crypto much wow strategy works  im a holder did like 2 trades in 6 months bought most of my positions early last year still holding around                 its been crazy days since new years eve indeed such parabola will take my time and look through your timeline have a great day mate                 they dont even bother to change the links poor scam performance anyways thanks for the shoutout                  its actually  the other one is fake thanks for the attempt though   didnt know that this one looks rather wasted though  looks like btc gets rejected at trendline suppoalready built a bull reversal 2nd is in the making little bit early to tell but looks rather well for now  decision time for btc amp alts prices should reverse to upside around here assuming the trend is still intact  house votes 256164 to expand trumps warrantless surveillance

  this is hilarious   thanks for sharing that article  that quote made my day   this is hilarious   thanks for sharing that article  that quote made my day    its not about whether the graphic is real or fake its about making a point that claiming xrp is decentralized is just not true thats all        it shows basically what decentralization is about a widespread network of individiual nodes contributing to single cause calling xrp decentralized and proving it with the map above is neither making any sense pseudo decentralization vs real decentralization       pseudo decentralization vs real decentralization   1 time for safe triggers is mostly over doge story unfolding  zcl doge much wow if you ever felt like writing me a personal message feel free to do so via  lettertodagobah  does not matter what it is you want to talk about i will read and answer whenever i have time to do so may you be blessed      early uptrend activated     this is the last time saying that  you remove my name from your post else i will staa disrupting marketing campaign it is alright for me to share your thing but dont include persons that have no deal in this to trigger more traffic here is an great example why we never must sell our cryptocoins in any dip  hodl altcoin cryptocurrency bitcoin          thanks a lot  wish you all the best removing unit bias if everything had the same supply cap as bitcoin would you still buy it   printed you mean   it is an undesired effect unfortunately but more followers should not mean less freedom for yourself to express what you think imho  congratulations mate keep it up youll come for the lambosbut stay for the decentralized revolution in individual freedom amp financial sovereignty leadi  as stated in the article i do not claim to be 100 right about everything when it comes to ripple but i gathered enough indications and red flags to not be invested nor recommend it  people stadoing their own research amp consider all factors thats all i wanted to achieve this is for everyone invested in xrp as well as everyone who is torn between being silent or speaking up    never  holding all including etc still happy about btc all eyes on btc   its called denial for a reason    there is a fullscreen button as well          buy real crypto or go home   also delete my name from your posts i have nothing to do with this dgb entertaining the same fractal as silver in my previous post just on a way smaller timeframe additionally golden cross of ema 100 amp 200 seems inevitable now bullish af if it manages to breaks the triangle to the upside   oh i think you will be surprised matter of time silver  as this statement seems to be confusing for some a bear trap is a bullish thing it simply means that everybody who sold or shorted the dip will hold a losing position which in turn means they are forced to close their position and thus drive the price higher  a bear trap is quite positive in that regard though   i mostly use both usd and btc charts to double the amount of information at my disposal for analysis so basically i am looking to have an edge in foreseeing potential market movements as a breakout in usd may lead to rise in btc and vice versa bear trap in the making at zcl  ripple is the blue pill   thanks for your consideration so far i had no problems with fees at all seems to work fine have no xrp address btc is the way      if you would detach me from your posts that would be great  would not consider it a wrong call as long as emas stay supportive  probably likely anonymous this  financial system remains propped up but it has zero chance of longterm survival it will be entirely replaced by something else and we have the opportunity to determine what that will be   its all fine   that ema retest before crossing will see   congratulations mate since i started out this whole crypto thing i never i repeat  never sold off any of my alts for a pumping btc  someti  agreed if you know you can handle the downside nothing wrong about watching however if the emotional component in ones decisionmaking is still strong just leave before you mess up your strategy impulsively  this is crypto deal with it  if heard poffertjes i like this post now ecbs yves mersch calls bitcoin a major threat to financial stability    egypts religious leader crypto trading forbidden under islamic law    sometimes thats the right choice indeed this too shall pass that panic selling             further validation etc retested previous highs in usd now looking up on rising volume emas offer stable suppo etc is coming emas bound to cross upside     agreed which is nice when you are in alts also the btc percentage chamight indicate the top in alts and bottom in btc in the future will keep my eyes on it as usual  working on another article focused on next year indeed just some more patience  smooth thanks for everyone being paof this magnificent journey it has been an amazing year looking forward to continue working with you in the future may you be blessed      i have used the btc percentage chafor years now it works prime will continue to use it until convinced otherwise but i get your points    some day when btc percentage is incredible low amp the majority of crypto holders will have forgotten that btc is king oh it will be glorious  means money is flowing out of btc into alts does not necessarily mean that btc itself is dropping in price btc percentage dropping below last low of june earlier this year which makes it an all time low first target would be below 20 for a measured move down might even turn into an extended leg below 10   thanks for your contributions very interesting to follow would you share the tool you use to put my light saber into your charts                       if true you would have had a disastrous year  observing ltc as well seems like a higher low has been established currently attempting to break the trendline ema 200 in h4 has been retested twice trend continuation would be the logical consequence  mind blowing ico bubble visualization  kudos     investment decisions in daily charts observing in 2h mostly   thats right it also helps to describe what you expect from this trade and reflect on it once the trade is closed   whats your point everyone who bought xrp that low has made some nice money of it if flexible opinions is not a concept you live by fine with me i suggest you stawriting some articles yourself and tell us what you know  you know you fucked up when you stainvesting in something you dont fully understand 100 premine 60 owned by ripple labs it is not even a blockchain doesnt take a genius to understand that xrp is actually digital fiat nothing more   opinions may change if there is new evidence or information available   its a great way to try out different things and experiment with indicators however whats missing is the emotional factor which only real money trading can teach how to deal with  not actively this is my channel here   paint force too strong   its quite complicated when you miss the initial entry thats why i plant my seeds early because chasing a market is always a pain however more odds in favor of upside check the daily chaand zoom out its still early in range update   prolonged patience will inevitably lead to more strength in the long run have faith  eventually having a trading diary especially in the first years of your trading career is boosting your learning although i do not maintain such a diary anymore i remember how helpful it was back in my earlier days  you might keep track on what you bought at what price the reason why you think its going to be profitable patterns trendlines indicators and most importantly what is your goal with this trade target zone or define parameters when you will exit then reflect afterwards  not yet you mean because you have already realized that bottleneck its a matter of time until you have solved it for yourself keep walking  having a trading diary might help as well  would zoom out more to get a proper context of the current price action however generally agree for now it has higher highs higher lows looking to break the trendline soonish volume bullish as well   books demo accounts youtube trading websites paper trading trading with small positions to get experience learning how to trade is a way only you can take yourself possibilities are unlimited if i would staall over again i would rotate between books and demo trading  i appreciate that it is quite a step to go public with your charts so congratulations for overcoming that resistance the way im doing it is just making a screenshot of the tradingview chapaste it into paint crop it then copy again paste into twitter easy  i am certainly not the best trader out there but where i excel is my ability to learn have patience and trust in my own analysis  agree probably retesting the trendline in lower timeframes for now any close above trendline on daily or confirming the breakout with a new high would be sufficient for a long to me  well it triggered the trendline on volume so i expect more upside in the coming days likely going to accelerate and retest ath in due time thanks mate same to you   earlier this year i called 100 etc which did not come to fruition yet anyway wouldnt sell anything below that let the pump unfold first when even etc attempts to pump this is promised to be an interesting year   vielen dank wünsche euch auch einen guten rutsch und ein wundervolles 2018  interesting     just looking at the chathats a solid buy i agree with many of the influential people in this industry i follow   if the market really wants   wish the same for you mate keep eyes open will publish something covering that soon  have faith in the force you must popped  zen interesting breakout  next target on chatry to catch a small pullback when it doesnt lift off from here         it takes time to seperate illusion and truth it takes time to have the courage to speak up what one really thinks no matter what in the meanwhile zen attempts the breakout   the way you can personally change the world is to take responsibility and speak your truth it has nothing to do with wealth  its simply not in their interest to create such a thing how can you possibly work together with them towards such a goal lol within each of us exists the potential to contribute positively to society although one individual among so many on this pl  i understand very well what this is all about i am however not sure if you have a proper understanding of either the economy the world is based upon nor crypto which makes this discussion pretty irrelevant  give the people back the legit direct control over their own money without anyone being able to interfere people will become their own bank thats the real revolution  we have two choices here  1 create a multicurrency global economy free of thirdparty intervention in a way that everybody can freely choose from thousands of cryptocurrencies to pay with 2 create swift 20 which is again controlled by the banks 3rd party  place your bets  i agree with replacing the old system with a new however with xrp you suppothe creation of the old system 20 which makes it one step forward two steps back the majority want too make money they dont care they want freedom but freedom isnt the same fo   i prefer a colorful multicryptocurrency global system in which you can freely choose with which coin you want to pay without being dependend on any third party  no i just still have faith in humanity   there is always time for truth and you are saying it  most likely banks are smarter than that and they certainly have a proper plan in place what is disturbing to me is that people dont even see the simple plan  truth is the only thing that matters really i may not always be right and it may never be easy but most certainly i am telling what i honestly think who cares what it does as long as it makes me money  everyone dec 2017  you will be remembered      2  i am a lone wolf with just this account i am not interested in steering markets or orchestrating pumps i never sold a single coin onto my followers in fact i rarely sell anything i apply my knowledge and try to help others thats about it  1  would generally disagree i do have many followers and i assume that some of them act on my calls which kinda increases the responsibility of this call being profitable which i by the way take on me voluntarily without getting paid    i dont want to open another discussion about xrp really but it seems necessary banks control ripple crypto was created because banks cannot be trusted yet you put your money into xrp although they control both price and supply invest one hour of your life see the truth   i agree i do the same work in the way that i extract money from the market and sell it to laggardsinstitution for xhundreds i do let the money work for me however i never lied to people nor dumped a single coin on any of my buy entries im just sharing my subjective truth  lost faith in xrp yoda has tfw you find an old bag of xrp that you bought around 0005 amp immediately sell it to some bankster laggards at x400 profit  priceless never underestimate what you can possibly achieve in one year just decide  then have faith i have done some research for best callers in month novdec 2017 best average gain for any  call with gold closed above 1300 an ounce for the 1st time in 5 years oil closed above 60 per barrel for the 1st time in 4 years  means that you buy into the developing trend early in speculation that it will accelerate later risk is generally higher with early entries but so is the reward  yes maybe it will   thanks very much mate amp happy hodling   much target  maybe  after zcl has successfully taken off many eyesa are focused on zec successfully retested previous highs making this an entry long after trendline break still very early  lmc low in range after failed breakout below suppoundervalued imho thats a buy    never put all ur coins in one basket never buy coins at such high prices there are tons of undervalued amp promising coins out there still buy low sell high   probably invested 1 btc around 5000 sold around 50000 x10 solid work and all that just within a couple of days price action never lies everything else is noise  ive been calling out zcl to our boot camp clients my price target is 300600 possibly 1k by the end of january if big i  most of the time basics work best and mean much more often than not   such generosity much gratitude  may you have a wonderful 2018  thats honorable sir added it to my profile description heres what our bitcoin price will do when we repeat our last 40 dip in btc 75k here we come  insane zcl   maybe that helps   true hope you are making some fine profits mate  give us some sneak peak mate were at the phase of adoption where most people have heard of bitcoin few understand why its valuable and even fewer actually  i did both  im out of business bro  im mostly not speculating on these things however one receives 1 btp for 1 btc while you get 367 btp for 1 btc being invested in zcl at moment of fork dunno where btp will be going but its nice to have a stack of that additionally  oh i hold as usual  tradingview   congratz just congratz zcl  merry christmas may the harmony be with you  your bank is about to go the way of the dinosaur     patiently waiting for the dollar dgb i have time      place ur bets etc price needs to follow projection to make it til new year   looks good to me just dyor as always   purely technical zcl breaking out of zone solid buy to me still very early     pretty much any book that really starts at the very beginning of trading dont get trapped by buying a rather advanced book first things first   unfortunately not they should translate it though such a valuable piece     normale version arbeitsbuch hatte ich noch nie in der hand    probably watching the same charts am a lone wolf pretty much  2018 will be the year of crypto hodl pivx   goldenage term finally established   pa2 of the story     if you ever find it hit me one of the most underrated charts in my opinion cryptocurrency total market cap horizontals have been spot on for sp   the last time we got a 12h bullish hammer we went from 10000 to 19891 in 17 days what dip  japan  nan when the dump is scary the bounce is epic  crypto         depends on your trading style 15min chaand upwards 2h4h probably best  read three books on trading in my life  1 das große buch der markttechnik by voigt basic beginner book 2 technical analysis by murphy advanced 3 reading price charts bar by bar the technical analysis of price action by al brooks master  gives you all you need  maybe maybe not figure it out we will retest breakout points  previous highs everywhere reversal territory imho both alts amp btc that was spectacular what i like to see now is a buying spree to get back above ath before the year ends btc epic tale crypto noobs vs veterans   one anonymous trader bought 1 million in options that will only pay off if the price of a single bitcoin surges above 50000 next year   btc that escalated quickly   thanks  for keeping track  update nxt x10 achieved congratz     nan  prices always referring to the chai posted watching the 15500 low very closely would love if btc is able to bounce up here and here comes btc to bring in some turbulence   any way to include higher res pictures in your posts to spot the details would be much appreciated  paof the evolution of a crypto trader i guess congratz to the profits m8  as i said this story is not finished to be told if usd accelerates in such a degree that you get new aths in xrpbtc would you be complaining then just have the patience to see it coming   i dont know i just know that i wont suppoit there are more honest and legit projects out there remember your money is a vote it might be profitable but if you are here for the crypto revolution with xrp you are supporting the dark side just an opinion of another man  i made a usd prediction not a btc prediction still if you see it from this perspective accelerated usd growth will inevitably lead to uptrend in btc which is about to manifest  i was a believer in the technical price action of xrp at 005 not particularly the fundamentals of that coin remember most dominantly i am a technical trader not a fundamental analyst   i respect various opinions and strategies and i know there is huge interest in xrp i must not see my personal opinion manifested im just here to spread information do with that what you must  its a 3d chamate 10 minutes in this candle is about 0002 its def not too late   its coming much faith here  you forget the most important factor in this story it is not yet finished hodl and watch the rest of da story unfold my work is almost done there is only one last bag of mine that has not yet popped but is ready to go xzc   premined not decentralized and generally a tool of the banksters to recreate the old fiat system just more technologically advanced eventually it is run by banks i am not supportive of banks however the profit potential was huge in the beginning of year views changed congratulations to the patient ones and many thanks for all the suppoi received during this insane journey my view on xrp has changed a lot during these months not a believer anymore but it is still good to see goals reached and patience rewarded      beware of ecoin  oh dont worry its still paint just some tradingview merge as well   zen   that would make my year its a x25 from here it is possible etc finally getting ready for that trendline break emas about to cross to upside  remember when everyone laughed about doge at 16 sats its gone now  xzc looking great here for the next move about to exit the ichi cloud bouncing over channel suppomacd

500 double bear trap about to get triggered to the upside forcing bears out of their positions expecting strong breakout emas already crossed bullish    etc       one of the last bags that didnt take off yet holding strongly and patiently will have its time  hopefully you are not buying nxt at x6 my suggested buy price though many coins available that are yet lower  soon update nxt   sure feel free  zec with a failed breakout under suppolikely leading to strong moves as zecusd already triggered 500 upside momentum to be expected  dogebtc 25 month high  dogecoin doge price reaches 25 month

increase in dollar value first things first thanks mate  those who followed are probably aware that etc is the only one left in the list predicted 100 at the end of the year doable  how much shit he took for calling xrp 1 i bet   is sitting somewhere with a big smile stock exchange operator deutsche boerse is reportedly considering whether to make germany the first european country to list fullfledged bitcoin futures contracts on a regulated trading platform    have no dog in this fight but when it comes to politeness you certainly dont win this race  i am inundated by people asking me for recommendations on cryptocurrencies if you would use your heads you would figur makes sense folks in the past were interested in the change crypto could bring to the world and were curious about the new tech now the herd is coming and the only thing they care about is to make some money hence yeah definitely google it  etc seems to be starting too zec with a higher low buy setup after trendline break  fellow crypto traders  enjoy this experience spend your profits wisely pay off student loans dont buy a ferrari t   talk to warren buffet about that definitive guide to making money in crypto  step 1 buy step 2 hodl classical_charting_101  lesson  the smaller the time frame 1 minute 30 minutes 1 hour 6 hours et al the less rel ltc took out iota as well now 4th in ranking watch your back bch     this   personal discussion with a fellow jedi do you think we should stalooking at usd graphs instead to determine entries or are btc graphs still valid  btc  ltc   when you suddenly realize that ltcusd going parabolic will lead to upside reversal in ltcbtc in the long run  differently and hopefully more responsibly time for a change  dont we forget those ancient coins ppc nmc doge pumping with btc and ltc back in 2013   believes in dao instead the amount of people not believing in ltc at 4 was too damn high congratulations to hodlers for x50 gains  chikun takes out ripple now 5th biggest mktcap attacking iota next   the only thing needed to compare two assets is a chaand price action that behaves similarly  a chart in a nutshell trade accordingly not the time to take risks imho  in case anybody wonders  the first bitcoin future lt0xbtgt trades are set to kick off at 6 pm est 2300 gmt on cboe global markets incs cboeo cboe futures exchange a new era is coming  etc monetary policy  december 11th        capped supply 230million etc anyone heard of this usd altcoin from what i understand is premined emission schedule secretly determined neither qua futures trading is coming  the shorts are at our door  they seek to destroy what we have built  the painful lesson they thats precisely what we want to see before takeoff a failed breakout into breakout point supporeversing on high volume last weak hands shaken out expecting other alts to follow in similar fashion  hey mate whats the current price of bitcoin  umm well its complicated   nope read the whole retweet bitcoin now just crossed 19000 roughly 20 minutes later what the fuck  bitcoin   1100012000 6 days 1200013000 17 hours 1300014000 4 hours 1400015000 10 hours 15000160  jep dont get me wrong i love this btc rally i just think its now in risky altitude and should be treated accordingly with care  would make sense from a technical perspective lets see what the future opening brings this   been there done that  crypto is a shot to generate enough wealth for a lifetime and then focus on most important things in life if that doesnt work out it only shows one thing being focused on money is the wrong path to take focus on important things instead anyway  thats the plan so it really dont matter much tweet length still not enough to include that thanks for pointing it out    only valid if you have all eggs in one basket  generally expecting money to flow into alts at a rapid rate once btc is cooling off  ignore overcome  only those who are attached to money and see it as a goal in life its not  good love it thanks either my strategy plays out or i go down with the ship in which case i go travel and meditate for the rest of my life nothing to lose here just different disguise dont take life so seriously place your best bet then go on there is so much more to explore the emotional shortterm trader vs the guy sticking to his longterm strategy its all about patience   lets talk in a year again   its not important that my opinions get validated or agreed upon its just an opinion of a man eventually the only thing thats right for everyone is to trust in ones own judgement and learn from it   just sticking to my strategy i saw this btc thing coming now expecting the other half of my strategy to play out as planned as well  except that you would not chabtc here but crypto in general the adoption is about blockchain not btc alone alts will have their time  not necessarily that but be very aware of the price movements in this altitude  brace yourself for emotional rollercoaster im all in alts will hodl no matter what until we get the rally i am patiently waiting for  nope people will exit btc not in favor of fiat but for alts expecting insane inflows story of btc in a nutshell no for realz it might extend yes but eventually it will come down for a much needed cooldown too rapid be warned   tought the same  its an hour glass  nan btc  the power of bitcoin is awesome to witness pay attention this is a once in a tradingcareer soof thing what is more likely to be achieved first btc  how can one not see the connection between gold and btc being the digital gold especially when btc went into correction at every important psychological level like 001 010 100 now 1000  you tell me thats what happened in 2013 all im saying  1 btc  10 ounces of gold important psychological level as 2013 rally stopped at roughly 1 btc  1 gold now we are at 10  hope you got your xzc bags  xzc with a interesting and likely profitable setup early entry  go chikun its your time to shine  this bitcoin chais insane oh wait thats actually a chaof us dollar money printing   doge retesting previous high around 20 its a cheap 2nd chance imho for those who didnt take the first signal   not available for any either  however good luck mate btc this would be a very ugly candlestick bar if it remains as is  blowing through resistance on a log graph  in 42 years of trading i have never seen anything like this btc btcusd b ltc hits triple digits after btc broke 10k  btc  4k check   5k check   8k check   10k check 12k tbd   100k tbd   patience always pays off eventually etc  nothing to see here move along   hypothetical what if a true hyper buying panic hits bitcoin and pulls marketcrashing amounts of cash from global stocks a   ht   in a nutshell  zec triggered   that the trade is still waiting to get activated activation when price reaches a new high green line still active zec  ath triggered  xlm on bittrex eth attempting to go for that ath in usd    under 500 sats wont make the fundamentals shine either       this str  ltc amp str   oh that one anyway  explosive move in the making  zec   hilarious captions amp congratz  busy holding my bags i accumulated in march  its infinite will have its time again it cant pump all at once not yet  doge   ᴰᴼᴳᴱ ᶠᵉᵉˢ ᶜʰᵉᵃᵖᵉʳ ᵗʰᵃᶰ ᴮᶜᴬˢᴴ  xmr triggered  doge triggered    i said buy when xmrusd breaks that ath because the momentum will be enough to paint xmrbtc green as well  xmr is a buy now xmrusd just confirmed ath breakout on bitfinex  we moved altogether majority of seats still in possession of loyal members  me rdy    agreed  and no targets as usual let the rally fully unfold  thats right if it confirms the ath break xmr will gain enough momentum to pump in xmrbtc so i would be buying xmr here xmr just triggered ath in usd things get interesting     check that out and no thats no hidden implication of what btc is up to whoever bought these 260000 btc at 001 during mtgox crash legend  selfcontrol is strength calmness is mastery you have to get to a point where your mood doesnt shift based on the in  patiently observing  will open seats in a few hours stay tuned for the announcement  very welcome    45 have not yet popped so there is still a lot of potential not the last market repoeither    besides we will open seats later today stay tuned   public market repoi published two weeks ago  in a nutshell be grateful people share their honest views publicly dont take it for granted  thanks  nxt up over 93 made 8000 on that call  crypto bitcoin ethereum its all about perspective    the hodlers life there are many dark nights but the dawn is spectacular  another way of seeing it  alts between depression and disbelief which means that the point of maximum financial opportunity has been reached now patiently waiting for the market to pop   same pattern as nxt    suggested buy price was between 7551100 in the repoits 1600 now hope you got your nxt bag at 755  1100 as proposed    does not matter if its the first breakout bar of an evolving trend in daily friendly reminder that bts is going places soon  youre gonna look back at this time soon and beat yourself up for not accumulating alts in this depression  just corrected that dont we forget that etc is the original chain while eth has turned itself into an immutabilityviolating chain to bail out institutional investors  doing something again means doing a gain  sometimes you have to go through a lesson several times to learn its essence every experience is a win because learning never stops if you begin to see mistakes as a way to improve you become unstoppable taking one step at a time    in a nutshell   only five daily bars formed so not much information available now people are searching for buy bitcoin more than how to buy gold    hyperinflation will deal with that eventually  done  btc  4k check  5k check  8k check  10k in progress 12k tbd  100k tbd amazing gif bitcoin crypto   cuz hes cryptoyoda his talk has transformed too  difference is the last pennant had no lower high  lower low pattern this current range does similar to the situation around nov 9th which led to a sharp drop curious how that will play out   people hear something and expect it immediately practice in patience is it finally time for btc amp alts to rise together 1y chalooks like it goldenage  great read amp thanks for coverage   btc generating lower highs lower lows in 2hr chadangerous in this altitude  ath twilight zone  when you watch a random youtube video and suddenly spot yourself on cnbc africa weird    litecoin transaction number is increasing fast recently and has reached all time high all statistics are showing that l  that might entirely be we all know btc is a beast still odds for a consolidation slightly higher for me btc at resistanceneckline of previous head amp shoulders volume on this leg not convincing expecting another leg down likely retest of 5k area  it would need a very strong breakout on significant volume through ath to convince me otherwise   might be whatever the logic explanation is the fact is we got a new ath which will trigger new buyers into the market as momentum is clearly upside now thats all that matters really new all time high alts market cap  all eyes on zec trying the breakout here some serious potential damage being done to btc parabola unless price rebound sharply on sunday  btc now below parabola what a day   sure bch has a pain this eventually it doesnt matter everyone looking at that chain the future will assess it as strength no matter what bch did at that day largest ever volume spike in alts marketcap  nxt amp omg both triggered etcbtc 1 month high  ethereum classic etc price reaches 1 month high on poloniex  etc btc alts investing cryp when i called bccbch at 006 i was flamed alive now its up 100 and everybody talks about it as if it is normal weird game this is ugly btc   thanks for that will figure that out for future reports  only gotta tell what i truly believe am big in both  if one buys something that does not yet exist one cannot wonder if he remains with empty hands altcoins  the people have spoken   nope etc is the original chain and never violated immutability might be its time to shine oh the drama why not reset everything its not like you never did it before manipulated chain is manipulated eth according to google trends global searches for buy bitcoin have  overtaken buy gold after prev exceeding searches for how to buy silver while some people posted that search interest for bitcoin blowing up altcoin search interest silently breaking out i wouldnt be surprised if we are at the peak of altcoin wreckage around about now  etc triggered dailyh4 setup  folks been clamoring to buy up btc to get into altcoins amp alts are at bottom of trend channel amp ready to explode amp moon any when everybody is agreeing that altsareback still takes 23 months it most certainly wont take 23 months easy as that ready for alt party soon  break it or make it moment btc  i gained followers by expressing truths nobody want to hear in the first place that wont change with more followers you are resp 4 urself   because we apply same ta methods  its not my job to increase creditability its my job to express my honest thinking and to comment what i see even if nobody agrees  got left behind ty  btc at key level if upside breakout fails i expect longer consolidation if breakout is true expecting 8k in a couple of days observing  just at btc key level awkwardtiming   only valid if we assume the energy providers wont sell btc to fiat immediately after receiving it from the miners making mistakes and fucking up is just a paof the game   everybody makes a losing trade  fucks up   learn from th excellent piece of work    add dominated by selfproclaimed ogs with a way too big egos snapping at everyone thinking differently sad but real traders underestimate importance of a positive mindset believing in your style and trading with confidence grows with pr  dont you think people said that in march too nonetheless current price level is at key suppoafter higher low and 2 buy signals on daily  umm okay thats some pretty volume at doge big walls at 20 though but if that breaks  despite various opinions about bitcoin cash out there here seems to be developing a fine opportunity   something is brewing majority is entirely blind to its movements due to prejudices i think it should be observed closely amp w an open mind nobody confused yet about bcc  bch trading volumes   feel ya  retest 80000 would be an option apafrom that its getting risky everything is possible but i believe its bound to upside now vtc broke last resistance now its getting really interesting dissatisfaction with status quo gt call for independence gt refused by state gt all in crypto  despite what you may think of it bcc seems to be ready after building bottom in both usd and btc this is technical only dyor  vtc looking solid when 100k breaks nothing but open air can you do it vtc   it does and my followers know that diversify dont go all in crypto get some sg too watchlist  zec higher low higher high setup on daily triggered dgb higher low solid buy volume not triggered 178 bcc at bottom   those who understand that pumps in usd likely lead to rise in btc sigh  so probably never 50 sats was early entry before the first major leg up those levels unlikely get retested again added dgb at these levels such a bargain below a cent     try al brooks reading price charts bar by bar zen on the move as well what a smooth day zcl seems to be on a move interesting pattern managed to close above suppoagain looking up might pop observing    just patience im operating on a higher timeframe than most any reversal in this context is significant you can do it ltc dont stahp  welcome back alts long time no see seems like after all the bitcoin gold story was good for something preparing for upside action soon   its not the time yet besides i scrolled through your timeline no own calls whatsoever so easy to watch on the sidelines isnt it fomo level activated lets see how much buying pressure there really is requirements for moon leg up are given btc  for the smaones its just very likely it will follow zen and zcl given these three have a rather close relationship one day they all will pop up do your research pick solid coins have trust you gotta be patient btc ltc zen zcl xzc   alts comeback under development all charts pretty much at bottom to me still takes some time to manifest though top sellers did not get filled at previous high suppoare now forced to buy higher which means fomo is lurking around soon significant  with str and bts making the first move other alts may follow suit in coming days goldenage is incoming matter of days now something new to live by  bitcoin crypto  while everyone is panicking about altcoins all i see is a rare opportunity to accumulate more cryptocurrencies at c  true for the majority however xrpusd about to trigger a solid signal that should be enough to lift xrpbtc  xrp might rally from here three wave correction is completed now higher low higher high attempt usd bound to upside as well  breaking russia to issue its own cryptocurrency the cryptoruble  btc trying to break out from low range  suppolooking to retest 5800 area if that fails likely correction down to 5000ish ltc same  my deepest thanks to the us government senator mccain and senator lieberman for pushing visa mastercard payal amex btc bear liquidations visualized  next level of parabola in development global fomo incoming btc will go to 100k  if you want it or not  btc wont care  media attention ltgt enthusiasm btc  4k check 5k check 8k tbd 10k tbd 12k tbd 100k tbd if you enter that code be patient it may take a while to load still legit  if you want to know yourself i mean really know yourself  the good bad and ugly  become a trader btc ath attempt in progress mainstream media on btc massive bubble mainstream media on stockmarket more room for upside    btc managed to pinch over rising wedge now lets see what happens strong volume breakout or failed breakout aka top  in that case keep calm observe amp wait for more information so it begins decisiontime for btc  btc currently in rising wedge bearish pattern however with chances for strong upside breakout key level to observe around 46504700  xrpusd breaking out might have implications on xrpbtc  odds are generally higher for a downside break out of this pattern however if breaks to upside it will likely result in a spike on volume seems like there is other parabolic thinkers out there  squarepeginaroundhole btc crypto    chartlove in a nutshell    i never said btc will die not once i merely pointed to the risk of the hf  no sellers as global fomo brings accelerated demand while sell books are empty no wonder if btc jumps several hundred or thousands per day  still 100 in alts bought the very bottom so almost no risk involved eventually i still believe alts is the better bet in the long run  just a matter of time next stops for me 5k 8k 12k retrace then 100k some day when btc is full throttle on the way towards 100k we will understand that it is real play it solid think longterm  the bitcoin smile  cryptocurrencies surge as dollar purchasing power plunges    great stats maybe combine mentions with the keyword buy in the same tweet might be way more accurate good work would love to see more second entry just triggered lets see what you got btc btc 3d chashows failed breakout below ema 20 last time that happened price doubled within a month    two weeks  next trigger is around 4120 finex prices would make this a

services in about two weeks stay tuned amp happy trading i will be creating free content soon what kind of content would you be interested in please give suggestions at     a possiblility not a fact imo observing for years there is powers in this play that comes from the deep state and its increasing observe lol    i think  definitely has a point the deep state will fight crypto and they will fail we are here to witness  today will go down in history as the beginning of the war between the  proponents of cryptocurrency and the world governments mcafee said fuck yellen fuck the fed the new world order is coming and i am coming with it  only this one multitasking is not my thing zen be like  dayz   welcome to the internetz  still in of course zec on the move trying to break out of buy territory note how zcl xzc amp zen are rising as well have all of them  xzc managed the breakout above trendline in daily on high volume looks solid  all eyes on xzc amp just triggered still in buy zone  another leg up for xzc daily candle about to trigger trendline on high volume  xzc just jumped out of buy zone now higher low looking upside for higher highs very early entry around this level  xzc  talking about this one    happy with nano ledger so far doesnt let you store all coins but at least a collection of the most important ones like btc ltc etc zec   when the value of their savings decreases rapidly they have no choice but invest it into the only assets that rise otherwise lose all   crypto is a catalyst to the meltdown of traditional debtbased markets amp will accelerate its degeneration buy crypto silver gold its all fine nothing to see here     same maybe this fullscreen bittrex chamakes ya a bit happy instead   doesnt matter what you call it as long as it works reliably  potentially  excellent read spot on   beauty of charts they work everywhere no matter what you actually measure btc measured move target is around 43704400 key level to observe    44004200 is resistance zone so lets observe price behavior around these levels strong rebounce after retesting previous high suppoat 3k which was a prime entry long resistance above if we break that line off we go   zen beautiful project as well both a longterm hold zcl is a buy to me at current levels after it got rejected at suppolooking up to establish full trend very early entry  google trends reached new all time high for btc after building cup n handle pattern upside motion incoming crypto   i dont run any paid service currently so no what do you get paid for justgiorgi when you try everything just to return to plain charts such magic  thx dimon either you are buying btc for realz which means you are even more manipulative as assumed or you triggered new interest fail  they tried to copy it fork it ban it clone it ridicule it launch at it discredit it and kill it and yet bitcoin livermore on big winners     call them whatever you like ed just watched your first video great work  google trends  still withdraw does not mean sell it means to protect what is yours seems like we are still just getting started we have seen nothing yet btc crypto globalfomosoon   true that but buying this thing is like fomobuying into a voluntary state surveillance program 1000 for a phone so i can passively contribute to states mass surveillance you must be nuts apple go home    failed breakout after three touches of trendline buy setup for me especially given the high volume on bull reversal bar good work  my strategy is to multiply btc by investing in alts seems legit lol     its another possiblility but i would feel more comfortable with a position if the lower levels will be hit   oh i know but it was a chance to add clarification things are so easily misunderstood on twitter   a retest after a spike like this might be a reality putting these levels out in advance just in case it goes that deep which must not be  usually trend goes from spike to channel to trading range in which then the lower end 1st correction after initial spike will be retested   in practice i dont sell fiat or usdt might be the safe option for that sure if you pick the right alt you might make some  but more risk potential buyin levels after corrective move down btc if we get that low   yep thats totally a possibility would provide a lower entry which is nice in the meanwhile alts recover quickly on usdt  btc reversal on epic volume at previous highs trend is intact continuation to be expected  big banks want to destroy bitcoin before it destroys them  mktcap shows reversal on high volume looks like bottom is set btc alts     classical charting 101 huge slugs of volume are either starting volume or stopping volume which one is determined by ch three hours   600 up btc  beauty     well bought  whats your point lol i bought the dip at 3k like i proposed earlier again saying to protect your coins thats all  btfd has nothing to do with my tweet withdrawing doesnt mean sell   its paof the game just like trading itself either you are right and everything is well or you fked and learn something from it  whatever you chose dont compare yourself to others you are unique  people generally underestimate the consequences of posting opinions publicly lots of hate pressure and nonesense we do that voluntarily  right so far but my daily target got hit so this candle would make a lot of sense in this context observing   well said  folks be grateful there are people publicly posting their honest opinions thats all that matters  its not its built on trust just like fiat  its not fud its a fact that you down any coins hold on exchanges just make sure to own the private keys of ur stuff  agreed both come with experience   may books be your source observation your leverage experience your teacher  there is no facts in technical patterns either just probabilities  what if is no useful factor in considering the profitability of a trade  thats the spirit seeing obstacles as an opportunity  real strength  btw what actually happened to boolberry daily bull reversal in the making observing    its never too late to learn   oh im hodling around as usual  please have a look at my earlier tweets expecting bottom around 3000 2500 worst case  governments try to stop crypto from succeeding which means they feel the heat which means things are about to get wild   he is using classic charting with 40 years of experience thats the kind of people you want to follow if you want to make it imo haven been that enthusiastic about crypto for weeks now understand that these new developments mark a new chapter beginning right here my first ff list     thats it gl classical charting 101 btc target of descending triangle met suppoat jun highs daily trend down recency principle  amibitous goals and dedication undervalued in todays society   nope  oh hornhairs bro ya changed ur name just want you to be safe its getting rapid in here   expecting the bottom around 3000 from which is reverses up  unlikely i am rarely following crypto twitter at all the fud and bs is not standable just expressing my beliefs  withdraw doesnt mean sell it means getting control over your private keys if you are on exchange coins belong them not you dyor  if you would follow you would know that my target is based on daily chart  oh people have a problem with me for various reasons let them i say my shit because thats what i believe is true  thats a significant number expect a bounce from the 100bn area rebound successful for now next leg down shows if it holds       state is trying to interfere and they will not sit aside doing nothing instead they will try everything at their disposal be safe we are entering the red zone in crypto which is characeterised as state intereference exchange shutdowns hacks on larger scale withdraw   wouldnt trust on that be safe withdraw your coins setup cold storage  i trust in technicals more than in news so yes thats where i expect the reversal to be happening  that would be supposuppolevels i see 3000 2500 reversal likely from a technical perspective on or between those levels  protect your funds withdraw cold storage be safe sitting here watching crypto crashing but knowing it will end up way higher eventually good for the rest lessons come without shortcuts  btcusd a doji or any of the reversal candles tomorrow would be quite interesting says bbands who likes candlesticks at the r btc almost at target retesting previous highs around 3k which is also a measured move down from earlier head n shoulders  on spot  silver si_f slv has been an absolute textbook example of classical charting principles at their best   entry has been triggered so the edge is upwards yesterday first bull bar next two days should make the reversal and end up higher the real crypto bubble will occur when we are well into the trillions effects will be felt on a  macro scale we wont be this    rather look into promising coins at the lower end of the range you cant participate in all of them so better focus on those with high roi thanks  keep up the good work its a pleasure to learn from your extensive experience and views     would love to hear  opinion on that if you would  would look into zen still evolving two great memes this morning bitcoin 6000     technically three waves are visible on daily chaso that might have been it

guess  something for the future as i plan to be staying longer around here i tend to be a little too early but mostly right about the direction  yeah i expect the next two months being insanely turbulent as bears get stopped out mass liquidations and global fomo starting three touches to the trendline then collapse and retest of lower channel anyways traditional markets  soon then crypto silver gold    who can predict the future after all this is trading you can just generate odds and learn from experiences always in motion the future is to those being reluctant to buy in again in the

supporting the price move so more upisde to come  xrp on the way to confirm the breakout of longterm trendline      both been observing ltc more than any other crypto chain my life got a pretty accurate feeling for its market  ltc above 100 this year prediction still active ltc about to trigger if you are not in yet you better hurry switchers are around   on flight mate ltc soon such volume

diversify more dont listen to news charts is where the action is happening  always  its about time hodl  triggered zec about to confirm the breakout dont wait too long this one will go places very soon   market in uncertainty difficult to trade at the moment everybody pushing buttons when btc make a little up or downmove  this is not for shortterm traders gt unfollow fldc on the way up on rising volume  xrp update after failed breakout unsatisfying as i like to be on spot outcome will be the same eventually so on we go  btc at lower channel line amp three touches of the trendline potentially failed breakout which would make this a potential reversal  ltc daily perspective retested suppoof previous highs triggered the reversal more upside to come  ltc triggered  btce   not before 100 ltc triggered at polo close to trigger at btce soon ltc getting ready for trend reversal in h4 to upside expecting strong movements  ltc starting      it is     any higher high would confirm the breakout is real as ema 200 is now below if we manage to shoot out to the upside here lbc is gone  xrp seems to be starting again after retesting previous high suppo still active  fct   not much to check fct is a buy to me  havent sold a coin for weeks ur argument is invalid   bro im not against xrp as a coin im against the ones in control behind it its a moral thing not a fundamental issue  102501 is safe entry but quite far away eth 1 march1 may vs xrp last 2 months history repeats itself coincidence  that  triggered entry at confirmation xrp 9804  because i dont sell this is the time to buy time for exits will come but it is not now   and that will just continue under xrp same story different disguise   i cant suppothe toxic fractional reserve debtbased banking system and arbitrary printing of money through the fed   but will still rely on the same values and morals like the old system as the same powers control it   so basically xrp is the attempt to reinstall a new system because the old system is fked up and cant be saved   its controlled by the same powers that established the current system which is not acceptable  yeah but more prominently i have been calling xrp since  0006  feel ya agree on that i use it as leverage to buy real projects that are in tune with my moral world view will elaborate in the future  green lines are suggested entries blue is always suppoor resistance xrp retested yesterdays entries now looking for more up entry here in anticipation or with any higher high  oh yeah and that  okay that was the show for tonight im out   that was not the question lel i dont really now but willing to find out  holding 100 etc no eth str  str next following xrp  looks like a very weak leg up as the right shoulder could become hamps eth traders getting back their long positions that they sold higher  xrp xrp on the move very early  etc starting now  if you buy what is being used you buy high anticipate what is being used in the future and buy that everybody watching btc sudden drop in the meanwhile zec  gotta agree that etc looks far more attractive to multiply eth holdings   im doing just charts and charts tell me its going  well its just accelerating now hodl if you are in if not wait for more information  retest this train is gone for now it seems gnt is at it again been trend riding since the bottom  gnt preparing for more action today    havent talked to  in private ever but i love his charts and timing  well if was possible to let people know which coin is a good entry without driving the price up i would totally do it its just side effect  agreed   thanks   that cause i trade with the momentum of the market it just appears to be my tweet but thats actually just the cherry on the cake    through is through congratz mate  soon unfortunately no nice entry atm exp next probably lbc  hold zec triggered  feel the force we do fatih approved  zec looking up  hope ya didnt shortterm  dgb  well at least someone saw the need amp setup a trollbox copy you dont have to agree with me its not important to me i just say what i think  clearly you swallowed the dark pill hush hush love to see different techniques being applied all coming to the same conclusion dgb    to me the reversal is pretty safe at 1271  well im not following any trollbox for a year now and its great    sure mate best is to check this out for more information      70100 is suppothus buy area wow thats great stuff check it out if you miss the polo trollbox   such beauty thanks for that   trading in the plane like a baus  well not sheeples at all to be honest many excellent traders looking for a room to exchange and work together  for now its just the statement    in your equation you forgot that the other coins will rise in mktcap as well  seems ur rocket isnt working properly  true was looking from a 15min1hr chaperspective  thanks mate good some see the truth besides all this fud   no  i added a position 1170 try to get as cheap as possible zec also in process of reversal here this one will be big well triggered 1169 is higher high entry  dgb    within 2 years    like always will be telling stories like  i once bought dgb at 50 sats wow you must be damn rich now nahh sold at 57     what made you think im trollin mister   patiently waiting for the dollar dgb i have time  new trollbox   or for more quality   might lets observe we dont have to buy straight away observe and when accelerates and builds higher highs be quick to enter thats what i mean  dgb supporetested now preparing for move up again  bitcoin is helping the pot business get over its banking problem   btc bitcoin finance cryp  sc is a buy no need to have on watchlist watchlist ltc dash nem etc xmr doge xzc zcl zen str cann  dgb in buy zone currently retesting previous high suppowould buy the reversal to upside on volume bnt fundraiser live massive attacks on network reports of ethereum transactions pending all who try 2 get in will be  thanks mate introduced steps  back in the game probably next steem amp lsk  oops whoever had this wall at 2000 ouch dgb triangle breakout attempt for more upside  its an instantbuy to me  gnt entry in 2h2w for upside trend reversal trigger is close 20352  great call to finally remove the trollbox from  it always ended up something like this  cryptographers are solving complex problems to change money as we know it amp im over here wondering if i need to includ why str breaking triangle higher low higher high now uptrend all it needs is the confirmation which is the trigger of todays candle   entry in daily just confirmed follow the trade in daily chafrom here str last chance 1895 at confirmation of breakout  hold  only when it moves  much in due time litecoin has its own way of doing things will surprise everyone     etoro is social trading platform afaik triggered str higher low entry into uptrend good luck gents  entries triggered in str etc xrp zec now wait and have patience survive the dip as usual be happy ever after    except i dont sell but always add more everybody is winning except shortterm traders who dont get a thing i do here triggered str obviously tr such a buy will chase xrp now   its an uptrend so betting on a failed breakout under trendline and buy any breakout above on volume xrp bear stop levels aka chainreaction  calling the bottom for xrp would enter a soon as possible now all eyes on xrp etcusdt already at trigger acceleration soon  etc seems to have found bottom buy the breakout to the upside of the triangle on volume or wait for safer signal   thats right but they panic sell rather yet im expecting gnt to close way higher later today would buy around here  people buy btc not for the sake of holding but to reinvest in alts therefore much willingness to pay at the moment prime opportunities  when btc moves up coin x experiences sell pressure as it is measured against btc which spikes  well if xusdt trigger buy signals that creates momentum and new buyers of course that will lead to buying in xbtc  boring whats with the other 78985  shortly bigcap coins i expect to rally soonish zec xmr str etc dash bcy one of the very last that didnt have a pump yet worth a shot imho entry 21901   only one pump then but the high needs to be retested so i expect crazy returns then forever decline due to inflation  i love zen very much chanot yet but the concept is ace observing zec for ages this one will go places try to get some as cheap as possible bound to upside zec instabuy  oops thanks for your sharp eye published a new blog post on why that btc upmove is good for alts may this be helpful       at least we got the ball to make tough calls checked ur twitter i dont see any just reporting life is so easy that way  nan risk  zen very early for the risky one among us  13 million dollar liquidation on okcoin futures  bitcoin btc btcusd   opened a little position to find out  whatever happens i love watching coin openings  there is best to check details here  zen just started on bittrex 1min action fullscreen    well i will give it weeks to months to assess the pump performance then see  is triggered  01 max for most seeds grow to many btcs  true it risky but bittrex doing good so upside is more likely also looks bullish af bittrex crazy action today gup looks interesting and has not started yet planted a seed    it implies the majority of new entrants will eventually become holders that means less sell pressure in the future more support  how can many will stay in crypto mean leavers they will hoard coins and never leave thus 90 bln is a joke   always in time from about 20 billion in total cryptomarket cap 6 months ago to about 90 billion today and many of those are going to stay in crypto ethereum inventor vitalik buterin meets russian president vladimir putin   eth markets inves participated in eqt ico trading platform on blockchain is the nextgen thing worth the shot imo longterm   whats the problem with this world  humans  1   using ema 20 100 200  005 btc  check for more info   i dont understand either mate  thats correct it would appear high af nobody wants to buy it its a trap theres always more upside to a chathan apparent  over the long haul yes experience of 5 years non stop cant be transferred just like that these things take time but we all will improve  well if etc and eth have parity current price of etceth is more than unjustified would be way higher  i do hold for years lets see if the devs can manage to reach their 1  10 goal whats there to lose  i would not try to focus on finding lower coins with great potential  always gotta survive the dip before being happy paof the holding game  has it oh oh eth  thats both technical analysis and fundamentals if the coin is strong longterm only upside possible gt accumulate  i am using charts mostly havent looked at mktcap of dgb back then as far as i remember charts tell a lot also dgb is not particularly special in terms of charts they all will look like that so hold ur bags buy low have the time then reap what i want to say with this the price you pay for buying coins at bottom very low is the patience you gotta have until it finally spikes my strategy in a nutshell by example dgb   its solely an interesting article no clues attached nan   only in downtrends and trading ranges not in bull markets   draco does look sexy indeed but couldnt find a website meh  that was detailed thanks  top name  xrp in buy mode now  str ready to go  dash soon entries repeatedly triggered last three days that means accumulation in low range before breakout  markets are in process of reversal buying in anticipation of higher prices in the future is suggested yep xvg is a buy here looking at h1 oh back in those times now dgb above 1k congratulations for hodling like a baus   that escalated quickly congratz  link will be sent to email some patience  nan  three months then  btc vs eth the battle may begin  correction almost done ready for second wave goldenage zec loading zone  if you got the ballz people try to dump on our heads thus slow down the leg up those will be left behind during rally amp act as fuel for acceleration patience  dgb entry coming up after trendline breaks in anticipation of a breakout above ath trigger is 795 on polo  exp attempted breakout of the triangle on rising volume would buy any higher high here if the last 2h candle gets triggered for a new ath  morning cryptofolks have posted an article about the current state of the altcoinmarket feel free to have a read     did last time so i expect eth acceleration with rising btc   it is the trading volume for etc during the last 24h so the translation is many hands are exchanging coins at the moment likely upwards update etc trading volume within 24hour   no matter how good of a trader you are 100 will never be reached etc is hot now preparing for upmove long time no finish in sight   if everybody gets dumped on why does everyone making money then your argument is invalid  dreams great messengers they are'"
